4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR runs, that's a gimme from Woakes, that's poor bowling. Short and wide, and the easiest shot Fakhar's had to play all innings. Stayed inside the line and cracked it through the covers.

4148,1stInnings$George Dobell: Did England miss a trick not opening the bowling with Mark Wood? Certainly the prospect of Wood and Archer in tandem is attractive. It's quite rare for England to have two 90+ mph bowlers in the same team (when was the last time? Harmison and Flintoff, perhaps?) and Wood might well have enjoyed the hardness of the new ball every bit as much as Archer. But England reasoned that, if anyone was to get these new white balls to move, it would probably be Woakes. And perhaps he doesn't have the other weapons - in particular the pace - to compensate once the balls are a little older. Archer, meanwhile, looks especially dangerous to left-handers, so it probably made sense to give him the other new ball. As it happened, Woakes gained little - if any - movement, though he did generate more pace than he has managed for a while. He touched 90 mph himself at one stage. Bringing on Wood - who might well be just a little quicker than Archer - as second change also offers a bit of bite in the bowling just as other sides might be introducing their medium-pacers and should keep the batsmen on their toes.

4148,1stInnings$Ali to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, Moeen finds grip and turn! Buttler takes the bails off and thinks he has his man. This was a beauty from Moeen. Drifts in from round the wicket. The flight draws the batsman out of his crease. The ball dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. The turn takes it past the bat and Buttler does the rest. Fakhar closes his bat-face and prods at it limply. The TV umpire has been called in to have a look at this. Fakhar can't drag his back foot back in time. Moeen provides England with the breakthrough

4148,1stInnings$Danyal Rasool: England's bowling to Fakhar has either been poorly planned or poorly executed. Teams generally figured out the best way to get him out was cramp him outside the off stump channel. Other than Woakes in the first over, that's never really happened. And too many balls have fallen right inside his arc.

He wasn't at his best - or anywhere near it - at The Oval and he has been working pretty hard on it in training. But he completed that neatly and quickly and will, no doubt, feel a bit better for it.

But if his inability to take wickets is blocking Plunkett or Wiley from playing, then I think England are making bad decision. It is just like Bhuvi in Indian team. He bowls economically, but cannot take wickets. Plus Bhuvi's bowling average is much less than Wood thanks' to his economy, so he is needed in the Indian team to contain the batters. Wood's average and economy are obviously not that great."

4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, overpitched and outside off, Hafeez leans into this slower ball and creams it between the covers and mid-off. So easy on the eye...

4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, this isn't as full as the previous ball, Hafeez drives on the up in the gap at the covers once again. He comes back for the second
4148,1stInnings$38.3
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, on the pads, clipped away to the man at midwicket
4148,1stInnings$Andrew Jones: "Obviously, Wood's inclusion not working out as intended. Hope they don't get anywhere around 330-350. This pitch has lost some life."
4148,1stInnings$38.4

4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, no run, slower yorker from Stokes, 112ks, dips at the batsman, jammed out. Interesting variation

4148,1stInnings$39.5
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, FOUR runs, Woakes bangs a slower ball on middle, Sarfraz lines up for a massive blow. He reads the offcutter, delays it, and swats it up and over mid-on. Played, Sarfaraz
4148,1stInnings$39.6
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, Sarfaraz backs away again, off-stump yorker, squirted away to the off side

4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, FOUR runs, slow, full again, and this time Sarfaraz is prepared. Lifts it over mid-on once more after clearing the front leg. Easy boundary
4148,1stInnings$40.3
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, followed the batsman down the leg side. The pair scramble a run
4148,1stInnings$40.4
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, short ball, but the field wasn't quite set for that delivery. Hafeez swivels and pulls it effectively to a vacant square leg
4148,1stInnings$40.5
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, full, but dragged down leg side. A diving stop at fine leg from Archer prevents the over's third boundary
4148,1stInnings$40.6
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, low full toss, and exquisite timing from Hafeez means it nearly goes all the way to the extra cover boundary, Expensive over, and great start to the final ten for Pakistan
4148,1stInnings$41.1
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, no run, full and straight, Sarfaraz mistimes it back to the bowler
4148,1stInnings$Dave: "I think the point re: Wood in for Plunkett isn't a bad reflection on Woody who's pace has caused problems, but more the middle over wicket-taking ability Plunkett brings is missing. Surely if you play Wood, then Woakes is the unfortunate one to miss out with the new ball? "

4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, low full toss and the batsman squeezes it into the leg side
4148,1stInnings$This should be a good contest
4148,1stInnings$41.3
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, slow and straight, but this is masterful from Hafeez. Opens the face of the blade to loft it over a packed offside infield. Once that was cleared, it was always going for four
4148,1stInnings$41.4
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, short delivery, Hafeez ducks
4148,1stInnings$41.5
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, extra bounce did Hafeez there. Looked like he was expecting a fuller one, but short and wide beats the batsman
4148,1stInnings$41.6
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, straighter, but Archer sticks with the short length, Hafeez pulls it to square leg for one
4148,1stInnings$42.1
4148,1stInnings$6
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Mohammad Hafeez, SIX runs, slightly legsidish, but chipped from Hafeez. What a chip, though! Excellent timing, right off the middle of the bat. No power whatsoever but struck it so cleanly it goes over the short boundary.
4148,1stInnings$Looks like Mark Wood is returning to the attack
4148,1stInnings$    Mohammad Hafeez77 (59b)

4148,1stInnings$Wood to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, fuller, and Hafeez picks it up brilliantly once again. The man at deep cover, however, lay in wait
4148,1stInnings$42.3
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, thick edge, and Sarfaraz promptly gives the strike back to Hafeez
4148,1stInnings$42.4
4148,1stInnings$W
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, gorgeously struck but it's straight to Chris Woakes at long-off! England were desperate for that wicket. Well hit, but failed to manoeuvre the bat face effectively, and as a consequence it goes straight to the man in that catching position, and Pkaistan lose their fourth

4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, no run, full and straight, clatters into Sarfaraz's pads. Loud appeal, but the umpire isn't interested. Perhaps an inside edge
4148,1stInnings$Bibin Baby: "Could we see the first century of this WC atleast today? Too long a wait it has been this time around." Now look who's jinxed it.
4148,1stInnings$42.6
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, no run, Short and wide, and Sarfaraz attempts to help it on its way, but beaten by the bounce
4148,1stInnings$43.1
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Asif Ali, 2 runs, Asif's first ball flicked to the onside. A suicidal two, and a direct hit would have had Sarfaraz packing
4148,1stInnings$Adnan Maqsood: "How many fielders England is keeping outside the circle, I believe they six on many occasions, even on the last wicket." Of course not, they brought fine leg up for Hafeez, allowing them the extra man at mid-off

4148,1stInnings$Archer to Asif Ali, 1 wide, too short, and the umpire calls it a wide, much to Archer's anguish
4148,1stInnings$43.2
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Asif Ali, 1 run, attempted hoick, an outside edge means it goes to third man instead
4148,1stInnings$43.3
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 2 runs, guided to the right of third man, and it's a comfortable two
4148,1stInnings$43.4
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, straight to mid-off. The off side infield is so packed it's always tempting to try and go over the top into vacant green grass
4148,1stInnings$43.5
4148,1stInnings$6
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Asif Ali, SIX runs, that one was exceptionally slow. Asif had time for a cuppa before he got ready to loft it over cover all the way for six.
4148,1stInnings$43.6
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Asif Ali, no run, terrific response from the bowler. 90mph bouncer, and this one is especially well directed. Asif scrambles to get out of the way
4148,1stInnings$44.1
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, slog, no timing, just falls short of a diving mid-on
4148,1stInnings$Jamie Dow: "Really hoping Morgan opts for a bit of Rashid's death bowling! It was Hafeez that was really getting on top of him, and he can be deadly when batters are trying to hit big shots off him."

4148,1stInnings$44.3
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Asif Ali, 2 runs, lofted over mid-off and excellent running. Asif takes advantage of a misfield by Woakes at long-off and allows Asif to come back on strike
4148,1stInnings$44.4
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Asif Ali, no run, short ball, Asif's swing was in no way designed to connect with it.
4148,1stInnings$44.5
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Asif Ali, 2 runs, thumped down the ground and a diving Stokes cuts it off at long-on. Not before Pakistan scamper another two
4148,1stInnings$44.6
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Asif Ali, no run, clever ball. Sarfaraz made room and Wood goes wide of off stump. Excellent over, just five of it
4148,1stInnings$45.1
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, full, slashed to long-on
4148,1stInnings$Joseph Askham: "What is the pitch doing? Any reason why England shouldn't be confident of knocking off the 340 ish they will be chasing? Could this have been the 500 pitch?" Don't think it ever was, but England will feel they've got a decent chance

4148,1stInnings$45.3
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 2 runs, short ball is too quick for the Pakistan captain, who top edges it into no-man's land. They come back for two, and this brings up Pakistan's 300
4148,1stInnings$45.4
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 2 runs, another mishit shot pays off. No timing means it doesn't carry to long-on, and the batsmen scuttle another couple. England keeping the boundaries at bay, though.
4148,1stInnings$45.5
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, FOUR runs, smart thinking from Sarfaraz. Picked up what the bowler was trying to do, and only had to clear mid-off
4148,1stInnings$45.6
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 4 runs, oh, dear, what's happening to England?!! They're in a bit of disarray in the field. Sarfaraz sliced the ball to point, who threw it at the stumps without a man backing up in the same post code. It goes all the way to the boundary!
4148,1stInnings$46.1
4148,1stInnings$W
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Asif Ali, OUT, and that spells the end of Asif. Cleared his front leg and smeared it to deep cover. It went straight to Bairstow, who lets out a growl of part-joy, part frustration. He'll have to knock off these runs, you know.
4148,1stInnings$Asif Ali c Bairstow b Wood 14 (17m 11b 0x4 1x6) SR: 127.27

4148,1stInnings$Wood to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full and quick, Shoaib Malik off the mark with a glance to square leg
4148,1stInnings$Rohit: "I don't think a '500 pitch' exists!! It has to be an insane day for you to achieve something like that as a team.. P.S. this comment was recorded in 2019. ;)" And if it does exist, it certainly shouldn't, is my view.
4148,1stInnings$46.3
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, looking to get it either side of the man at 45, Straight to him, though
4148,1stInnings$46.4
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, and again. Adil Rashid at 45 is earning his dues right now. Another scampered single
4148,1stInnings$46.5
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, thumped down the ground again. No timing, as has been the case too often. Goes on the bounce to long-on
4148,1stInnings$46.6
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Wood to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, short, Shoaib tucks it into a little nook into the onside and another two is scurried
4148,1stInnings$47.1
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 2 runs, sharp running again by Pakistan. Shoaib takes on the long-on fielder and beat him
4148,1stInnings$Abdul Azam: "No body even noticed sarfaraz's fifty well played captain and i believe this is not gonna be publish." Indeed. Well done, Sarfaraz

4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Sarfaraz Ahmed, OUT, Woakes gets his man at last! Slower bouncer that Sarfaraz unwittingly scoops into the air. Woakes runs the length of the pitch and then some to take a very good catch, and Pakistan are six down
4148,1stInnings$Sarfaraz Ahmed c & b Woakes 55 (68m 44b 5x4 0x6) SR: 125.00

4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Shoaib Malik, 1 wide, slower ball, well wide down the leg side
4148,1stInnings$Owen: "Over rate suspensions in play this WC? If so, Morgan might be in trouble considering his recent ban for a similar offence" Slate is wiped clean at the start of the World Cup. One more and he'll be in trouble, though.
4148,1stInnings$Anyway, Wahab Riaz is in
4148,1stInnings$47.3
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, slower ball again, and Shoaib Malik knocks it into the onside to give the new man his first ball
4148,1stInnings$47.4
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Wahab Riaz, FOUR runs, dragged his line down legside again. Easiest boundary Wahab will pick up. Got a fine touch on it to take it racing away
4148,1stInnings$47.5
4148,1stInnings$W
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Wahab Riaz, OUT, and that was all she wrote for Wahab! Wild swing, but the ball skied and point gets underneath it. No fireworks from Wahab today

4148,1stInnings$Assad: "Did somebody noticed, Woakes has taken 4 catches?" Good spot. He's in elite company.
4148,1stInnings$48.1
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Hasan Ali, 2 runs, spooned to long-on, and the pair rush through for two. Hasan needed the dive to make sure he completed it

4148,1stInnings$Archer to Shoaib Malik, no run, wide, and Shoaib Malik swishes at it with no luck
4148,1stInnings$48.4
4148,1stInnings$1
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, another slower ball, but Shoaib manages to guide this one to third man
4148,1stInnings$48.5
4148,1stInnings$0
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Hasan Ali, no run, short and wide. Hasan swings like a rusty gate, to little effect
4148,1stInnings$48.6
4148,1stInnings$6
4148,1stInnings$Archer to Hasan Ali, SIX runs, and the final ball of the over ruins what's been a great one for England. Muscled over long-off and absolutely sails over the boundary. It's a short ground, but hard to explain how well that was struck. It was bludgeoned!
4148,1stInnings$49.1
4148,1stInnings$W
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Shoaib Malik, OUT, edged into the air, and while it swirled around interminably, Morgan was the man getting underneath it. Took a difficult catch while making it look very simple

4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Hasan Ali, 1 run, mean. Sharp bounce tonks the batsman on the helmet. Seems to be okay though
4148,1stInnings$Stevieb: "No panic. England are capable of getting 360+ on this pitch so Pak might be a few runs short here"
4148,1stInnings$49.3
4148,1stInnings$4
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Shadab Khan, FOUR runs, unlucky for Wood. Shadab cleared his front leg in an attempt to go to cow corner. Instead found the top edge looping over Buttler's head to an equally desirable outcome
4148,1stInnings$49.4
4148,1stInnings$2
4148,1stInnings$Woakes to Shadab Khan, 2 runs, driven to long-on, and a poor throw by Jason Roy allows the batsman an overthrow
4148,1stInnings$49.5

4148,2ndInnings$2.49pm Hello again, everyone. Thanks, Danyal. YJB and Roy - who didn't quite have a great day in the field - walk out to open England's 349 chase. Pakistan will open with legspin in the form of Shadab Khan. Danny got his strategic punts right in his preview, didn't he? Tahir was the one who dismissed YJB with the new ball in the WC opener.

4148,2ndInnings$Shadab Khan to Roy, OUT, Shadab pins Roy in front. The finger goes up, but Roy opts to challenge the on-field out decision. This looks pretty plumb, though. Pushed through on middle, Roy stretches out for a sweep, but this is too full for the shot. Has Roy snicked it? Nah, no bat involved and the UltraEdge confirms it. The tracker returns three reds and Roy has to go. It would have crashed into off stump. Tahir had got Bairstow early in the WC opener. Shadab now gets Roy. The departing batsman, however, isn't particularly happy. He has a word with umpire Erasmus before trudging off. Legspin with the new ball is England's Achilles heel

4148,2ndInnings$Kuldeep: "Hope Pakistan wins this. England's batting is already so dreaded, and if they pull this chase off, it will give that monster batting an even bigger confidence boost and will really make them nearly unbeatable this WC!!"

4148,2ndInnings$Wahab Riaz to Buttler, FOUR runs, that beats extra cover, but only just. It's the timing that makes the shot. Initially looked uppish, but lands well short of the fielder and wide enough to his left to ensure he doesn't have a chance. Vital boundary for England

Moeen leaves his crease, closes the bat-face, pokes limply, falls over and edges it behind, but Sarfaraz isn't quick enough to close his gloves around it. Big deflection. Big chance missed

This was pitched up and wide outside off, Buttler reaches out for the ball and shovels it away with the bottom hand in the air to the left of mid-off. This is England's fastest World Cup hundred. Top innings from a top batsman. Will it turn out to be a match-winning knock?

4148,2ndInnings$Mohammad Amir to Buttler, OUT, Amir fools Buttler with an offcutter and wheels away. Pakistan are still in this. Amir ensures they're still in this. This is the variation - the offcutter that is short and swerves away outside off. The extra bounce means Buttler can't line this up. He slashes and top-edges it into the lap of short third man
