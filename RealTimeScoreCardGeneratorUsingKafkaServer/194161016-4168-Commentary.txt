Reminded of Jayasuriya's dismissal against Srinath that sent an entire nation into tizzy - albeit temporarily - during the 1996 World Cup semi-final in Kolkata. This was short, had enough width, he threw his bat at it to get a thick outside edge, this was in the air for a while, Moeen picked it early, took a few steps in, settled underneath and pouched it quite nicely.

4168,1stInnings$Wood to Fernando, OUT, he's upper cut it straight down third man's throat! What have you done Avishka, you were looking so in control... Short ball outside off, and for some reason he thought it would be a good idea to just gently upper-cut it, help it along its way as it were - except Adil Rashid was stationed at third man, so it was always a shot with high risk. And he's duly gobbled up, taking a few steps forward

It's not mindless slogging like T20s can be, yet it still has monstrous innings (see Morgan, or some late order cameos) whilst giving a more even competition between bat and ball. And on the other side it's far more accessible and shorter than Tests, and you always get a result. A perfect balance - never trust anyone who wants to discard of 50 over cricket!" If I look back on some of the things I was writing about ODIs in 2004 ... I can't believe I agree with this point of view!

4168,1stInnings$Rashid to Mathews, 1 run, nicely tossed up again, and Mathews tries to heave it over cow corner but mis-times the big on-drive, the ball trickles to long-on
4168,1stInnings$39.3
4168,1stInnings$2
4168,1stInnings$Rashid to de Silva, 2 runs, they're trying to attack Rashid but can't seem to time the ball. Another slog sweep to a flighted delivery, mistimed to long-on

4168,1stInnings$0
4168,1stInnings$Rashid to de Silva, no run, went for hte reverse sweep but with all the conviction of a butterfly facing a bulldozer. Or some better analogy. Anyway it was half-hearted and this was a length ball outside off that he couldn't lay bat on

4168,1stInnings$0
4168,1stInnings$Rashid to de Silva, no run, and Rashid ends his spell with one that the batsman can't get on top of - apt for how Sri Lanka have handled him. Flighted on the stumps, tried to cut it, no timing at all as it rolls to point
4168,1stInnings$40.1
4168,1stInnings$2
4168,1stInnings$Root to Mathews, 2 runs, De Silva dives at the non-striker's end but he could be in trouble here. good length on off, spinning into him, tucked to deep square. Mathews is not the quickest, but the dives has saved him. Had set off for two immediately, the early decision helped him, and was committed to diving in

4168,1stInnings$Harris: "Is the forcaster down to 248 because of the Sri Lankans slow going? If so this has to be the first time i've seen this happen because of low run rate and not loss of wickets" - it is indeed due to the slow down. Forecaster takes into account the bowlers remaining and how the batsmen remaining are going to do against them.

4168,1stInnings$42.3
4168,1stInnings$2
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Mathews, 2 runs, inside edge goes to fine leg but he got so little bat on it, Liam Dawson is able to run around and cut off the boundary. Another off-cutter by Wood and another attempted swipe gone wrong
4168,1stInnings$42.4
4168,1stInnings$1
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Mathews, 1 run, dug this in short and quicker this time, but he had to fetch the pull from outside off, so ends up toe-ending to mid-on, where Archer dives and stops the ball
4168,1stInnings$42.5
4168,1stInnings$0
4168,1stInnings$Wood to de Silva, no run, backing away to give himself room, but another off-cutter that grips in the pitch lands on a length on off, and the bat swing connects with air
4168,1stInnings$42.6
4168,1stInnings$1
4168,1stInnings$Wood to de Silva, 1 run, you have to give it to Sri Lanka that they're trying to hit out. They're just doing a horrible job of it. But it's not easy when Wood sends one down like this at 147 kph, following a succession of mid-120s balls. Swatted to mid-on off the toe-end

4168,1stInnings$Archer to de Silva, OUT, Root leaps to his left at mid-on and pulls off a super catch. Slower ball, leg-cutter at just 111 kph, pitched on off and moving away. Another mis-timed pull, it was only a matter of time before one of those went to a fielder. This one almost didn't, came off the toe-end and travelled to mid-on, where Root ran to his left and leapt up to pluck the ball.

4168,1stInnings$The wicket has pushed Forecaster up from 238 to 244 - because it's Thisara Perera out to bat, and he is expected to score quicker than Dhananjaya

4168,1stInnings$S. M. ZUNAIR : "What is good total score here at leeds for sri lanka to win?? " - I would have said at least 300-plus but don't think Sri Lanka can reach there. They just need to get as many as they can and put up a fight in the field and with the ball.

4168,1stInnings$Wood to NLTC Perera, no run, quicker one to Thisara, 144kph and well wide of off stump, another wide yorker. Thisara does his stand and deliver routine but he'll need to move his feet to get near that - and he doesn't

4168,1stInnings$Archer to NLTC Perera, OUT, caught by Rashid diving forward at third man.

4168,1stInnings$Forecaster still says 231. I say Sri Lanka aren't likely to get that many either.

4168,1stInnings$46.3
4168,1stInnings$4
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Udana, FOUR runs, much-needed boundary, though not where he was aiming at. Short ball outside off, Udana has a big swing at it, it flies off the bat face over point - he was targetting over midwicket
4168,1stInnings$46.4
4168,1stInnings$W
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Udana, OUT, backing away again, Wood does his shtick where he follows the batsman. Bowls it back of a length, no room for Udana to pull, but he goes for it anyway. Gets it high on the bat, and it loops up. Root at mid-on takes a few steps back and settles under it.

4168,1stInnings$48.3
4168,1stInnings$W
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Malinga, OUT, the old two-card trick works. Quick bouncer followed by inch-perfect yorker. Hits the base of leg stump - Malinga's exposing all his stumps backing away - quicker than Malinga can bring his bat down for his attempted slash through the off side.

4168,1stInnings$Amey Gupte : "This World Cup was set up with a very good format to be most competitive. Alas, the gap between top 4 and others (mentally and skills wise) is just too wide! The top have been table toppers since week 2 and that doesn't seem like will change - SAD."

4168,1stInnings$2
4168,1stInnings$Wood to Mathews, 2 runs, slower yorker follows Mathews who was backing away and he can only dig it out to mid-on. But they are alive to the possibility of two runs and they get it, with no England fielders nearby.

4168,2ndInnings$Malinga to Vince, 1 run, very full, slung into the legs, and clipped behind square to get the innings up and running
4168,2ndInnings$2.26pm Here come the England openers. Jonny Bairstow, fresh from a feisty 90 v Afghanistan, and James Vince, who probably could do with a decent knock today, just to reassure himself and his team that he's an adequate stand-in for Jason Roy... the extent of whose hamstring injury remains a bit of a mystery... Lasith Malinga has the new ball. Play!
4168,2ndInnings$2.23pm Vivek: "Heh, this world cup is reminding me of umpteen men's tennis grand slams from the past 15 years, where the only thing I'd do during the first week and a half was wait for the Fed/Rafa/Djoker/?? semifinals to arrive. " And Murray, don't forget Murray ... the New Zealand of the big four.
4168,2ndInnings$Parthee: "It's interesting to hear from David Willey who was not happy after his exclusion in the world cup squad and his current thought of England's performance so far in this world cup" I'm sure, deep down, he'd recognise that the selectors may the right call. He's got a busy County Championship programme to keep him occupied.
4168,2ndInnings$2.20pm Andy J: "Regardless of the result in this game, this is the 5th time in 6 games that the England bowlers have held the opposition to less than 300. All the talk before the tournament was about the England batting, but I think other teams will see that they aren't the one trick ponies people were saying before the tournament." I agree. Archer has added a new cutting edge, but so too has a fit Mark Wood. If Rashid can get the rip back in his action, England are well placed in the bowling front.
4168,2ndInnings$2.15pm Hello again, so, 233 is the target. It's hard to see an upset, isn't it? But you never know... that's the beauty of cricket!
4168,2ndInnings$Jibran: "Looking at the performances of different teams. The WC is essentially a 4 teams tournament!! The real WC will start with 1st Semi Final. " Sad but true. Though I do feel sorry for Bangladesh ... two seriously impressive wins against South Africa and West Indies, two hard-fought losses against Australia and New Zealand. Had it not been for a wash-out against Sri Lanka, they might well be in the mix still. They aren't completely out of it, of course, but they'll need to beat India to have a chance.

But yes, I suspect his newbie status has played some part. Be interesting to see what happens against India... he's no stranger to the IPL.

They are the only team in this world cup who never got all the 10 wickets of teams like SL, AFG.

Present scenario makes top 4 teams more or less equivalently placed, notwithstanding the argument 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd since in knock-outs its all about having a good day or conversely bad day. So ipl like playoffs are fairer to the teams 1 and 2." - Will you feel the same way if the team you're supporting finishes 3rd, but level on points with 2nd? And because of net run rate or rain maybe, 3rd placed team has to play 3 knockout matches to win? While team 1/2 have only 1 knockout match
