However, what's baffling to see is his inability/unwillingness to rotate strike and keep scoring at 75-80 SR. Puts too much pressure on rest of the batters " --- Think he's playing the situation. India have a longish tail today with the bowling at their disposal, so best to lay a platform to go big in the last five overs or so
4169,1stInnings$Drinks as well
4169,1stInnings$Shabaib miserable current form of Dhoni? He scored a century in warmups. Only came out to bat in slog overs in last 4 innings and got out trying to slog. This is the first time in CWC that he has got opportunity this early in an inning. He is building his inning slowly as he usually does and I am sure he will make the most of it. "

This was worked away to the leg side, and Jadhav ran towards the batsman's end without Dhoni attempting a run. Rashid jogs to his right, picks up the ball, and has a clear chance of a run-out at the bowler's end. In fact, Rashid has way too much time, and he rolls the ball along the ground so that Gulbadin - running in from mid off - can remove the bails. But Gulbadin expected a faster throw, and he's on the floor, with the ball dribbling past his left.

Yes, it will come back to haunt some team somewhere when it's the final ball of the game and an umpire messes up. Honestly, I'm desperately waiting for that day!!

4169,2ndInnings$Shankar: "It may be very brave call, but Rahul looks good at 4 in this WC. I think they just do one straight replacement of Dhawan with Pant at the top of the order. Let's have left and right combination"

4169,2ndInnings$Venkat: "Indian fans should just relax and not start name picking on who to be replaced for the next game.

4169,2ndInnings$Mohammed Shami to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, OUT, that's the hat-trick! Full, fast, and goes through the batsman again. Chetan Sharma did it in 1987, and 32 years on, here's Mohammad Shami, finishing off with two perfect yorkers, to win it for India! Mujeeb backs away and tries to go down the ground, but there was searing accuracy about that ball. India get their 50th World Cup win with that, but well played Afghanistan!
