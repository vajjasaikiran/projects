4146,1stInnings$Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, OUT, bowled him. Or has he! They're checking the front foot with the third umpire. It was very full on the stumps. Starc could see off the previous ball that Shahzad's footwork wasn't engaged this early and he got this one to swing in but this time on the middle stump line. Shahzad was late trying to stab it out playing slightly across the line. The front foot is deemed to be just okay in the end. Super start for Starc.

But Smith, the puma in the ring! Gulbadin never left more than a few yards from the non-striker's end seeing Smith's effort but Nabi is so far down that Smith has time to get up off his knees and deliver a firm throw to Carey at head height on his way to the stumps and knocks the bails off with Nabi three yards short scampering back in vain.

4146,1stInnings$We're having a delay for a number of reasons. Sightscreen issues, and one of the Afghanistan batsmen had to make a quick visit because nature was calling, as per Michael Atherton on air.
4146,1stInnings$Saif: "I don't understand why Australia didn't go for the kill like WI or NZ. They should have gone for all out attack and perhaps should have given longer spells to Starc and Cummins. Should bring Maxwell now to take wicket of Najibullah. " - well, looks like they're going for Starc. Afghanistan's sixth-wicket pair have counter-attacked so well that Finch has been forced to turn to his strike bowler once again. Let's see how this contest goes.
4146,1stInnings$Romal: "Najibullah always playing crucial knocks against tough oppositions, remember his 56 of 56 against New Zealand in WC2015. Want to see some more big hits from him."

Clever bowling by Stoinis, he bowled it slower which meant Naib couldn't get the timing right.

4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, no run, back of a length, and nice carry (to Carey). Yes I know, terrible pun. But good bowling. Outside off and moving away a touch, the batsman connects with air trying to cut

4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, no run, and he's chosen to shoulder arms, perhaps safest option to a ball outside off

4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, FOUR runs, that's a strange shot but he'll get a boundary. Another sharp short ball, and Dawlat stayed static and went for the pull, but he was also getting his head out of the way and almost connect without looking at the ball. Luckily for him, connection was good and he gets a boundary to square leg
4146,1stInnings$34.6

4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, OUT, can't do it twice in a row against Cummins! This time the short ball is directed over leg stump, so Dawlat's short-arm-jab-I-won't-look-at-it pull isn't quite as effective and he feathers an edge through to the keeper

4146,1stInnings$Stoinis to Rashid Khan, SIX runs, Oh my Rashid he's just taken 21 runs off this over! This was the most stunning shot perhaps. Short ball, climbing onto his head and he gets back and across to be in great position to hook it over square leg

4146,1stInnings$6
4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, SIX runs, ho ho ho, Afghanistan's spinners are having fun - with the bat! That's a top edged six. The downside to bowling quick is that when a Mujeeb backs away to pull, and gets a top edge, it flies over fine leg!
4146,1stInnings$36.5
4146,1stInnings$1
4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 1 run, oooh, that might be painful. Struck on his fingers, back of a length ball cutting in. Cummins was following the batsman who was backing away and Mujeeb had to fend it off from near his chest towards midwicket

4146,1stInnings$Zampa to Rashid Khan, OUT, and he's reviewed after being given out lbw.

No edge, and three reds on ball tracking. End of a super little cameo.

4146,1stInnings$Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, no run, that's some interesting play. Mujeeb was walking across very much, but Cummins followed him with a short ball that he ends up having to fend in ungainly fashion from in front of his face
4146,1stInnings$Supradeep: "Afghanistan has been impressing me with their big heart for a long time. But this batting performance I think is one of their best ever. This score card is anything but an aberration. They have stood up to the fastest bowlers around on what is seeming like a very good fast bowlers track. Elsewhere established teams are still not able to get it together on similar conditions. Thoroughly inspiring."

Of the Asian sides to play so far, they've put up the best fight with the bat over the first three days. Still monumental underdogs to defend this total.

Cummins did the same thing with his first ball of the match in the second over and now Dawlat matches him with a strange mental lapse. How do you not have your run-up correct at the start of your spell? Fullish length ball that Warner shoulders arms to but it doesn't count as part of the over.
4146,2ndInnings$Mujeeb gets yanked after two very tame overs. Dawlat Zadran enters the attack with more fast-medium pace. One slip in bowling over the stumps to the lefty Warner.

Dawlat stood mid-pitch never bothering to get back over the stumps while Zazai was slow moving to cover the stumps from mid-off as well. Double-lapse not covering the relay or else the bails could've been knocked off easily. Dawlat gestures at Zazai upset at him for not covering but he is as much to blame.

4146,2ndInnings$Hamza: "4 one-sided matches in the world cup so far. What does your score predictor say for the remaining 44 matches and today's champions league final?" - says the magic formula for exciting cricket is to log on to ESPNcricinfo and get 10 other friends to log on. Who must each get 10 friends too. And so on...

4146,2ndInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Smith, OUT, anti-climax wide outside off and it was there to be square driven, but bounced a bit more than he expected and he gets an upper edge that loops to short third man. Smith falls with just three runs to get for victory

4146,2ndInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Maxwell, FOUR runs, well my forecasting skills are not exact but Maxwell does finish it off with a boundary. Full ball outside off and slaughtered over extra cover, two bounces into the fence to clinch victory for Australia.
4146,2ndInnings$So it won't be a fairytale comeback of Smith and Warner sharing an unbeaten partnership to drive Australia to victory. Maybe Glenn Maxwell will hit a six to finish to compensate?
