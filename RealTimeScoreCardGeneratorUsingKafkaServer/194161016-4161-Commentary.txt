4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, FOUR runs, oooh, that was a moral victory for Hasan, but India are off the mark! Came back in and tucked Rohit up. The batsmen gets an inside edge on one that nipped back in, and there was no preventing it running through to the boundary.

4161,1stInnings$3
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, 3 runs, a bit too straight, and quick as a flash, Rohit works it away to square leg. The infielder has a chase, and just about prevents it going to the rope. Hasan's first over brings nine.

4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Sharma, no run, brilliant bowling. Rohit looked like he was coming forward and Amir knocked him back with a sharp bouncer. The footwork wasn't there, and the lazy pull barely missed the top edge
4161,1stInnings$2.3
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Sharma, no run, the angle takes this one away. Swing doesn't seem to exist for now, and Rohit leaves it alone. Amir has been warned, officially, for stepping onto the pitch.

4161,1stInnings$3.3
4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, FOUR runs, lovely straight drive. Rohit is getting himself in very nicely. Perhaps a touch too full from Hasan, and this time Rohit's drive to mid-off just about evades a diving Wahab Riaz
4161,1stInnings$3.4
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, no run, wider and shorter, was there to be cut away. Exactly what Rohit tried, but misses out

4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, no run, angled away from the right-hander. Inswing not there, but it does play on the batsman's mind, so remains a goo option

4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, FOUR runs, bouncer, and Rahul pulls aggressively at it. Doesn't nearly get it off the middle, but with the fielding restrictions, there was no one at midwicket, where it trickled away for four
4161,1stInnings$4.3
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, no run, good comeback. Back to the stock length delivery that threatens to move in. Rahul cuts, but gets the inside edge and bounces over the stumps

4161,1stInnings$4.6
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, no run, slower ball, a bit of an offcutter, and it beats the batsman's defensive block. Good over from the bowler, but the warnings will play on his mind
4161,1stInnings$The problem with Amir seems to be laziness. He jogs into the danger area on his fourth step. No reason why he can't avoid that.

4161,1stInnings$5.4
4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, FOUR runs, short and wide, crunched away by Rohit, Poor delivery, but it was in the air at point so long Imam fancied he was in with a shot. He puts in a valiant drive, but it's just wide of him.
4161,1stInnings$5.5
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, no run, on target, and quicker (87mph). Rohit lets it go
4161,1stInnings$5.6
4161,1stInnings$6
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Sharma, SIX runs, oh, what a shot! Rohit is on the march now! Short of a length and the batsman takes a step back and lofts it over cow corner. It's higher than it is wider, but it was timed so sweetly it just about carries over the fence. Another expensive over from Hasan
4161,1stInnings$6.1

4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Sharma, 1 run, short and straight. Rohit blocks and runs
4161,1stInnings$6.5
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, no run, close, that. It took Rahul's inside edge and went through to fine leg, which is standing up now
4161,1stInnings$Meanwhile, this is what the law says on running on the pitch: *Bowler running on protected area* It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his/her follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or not the ball is delivered. If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this Law a third time, the umpire shall direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling.
4161,1stInnings$6.6
4161,1stInnings$1b
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Rahul, 1 bye, gets some movement after it bounces. Moves away from the keeper, allowing a bye that means Rahul will keep the strike against Hasan. Which might relieve the bowler
4161,1stInnings$7.1

4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Rahul, 1 run, tucks it away to square leg
4161,1stInnings$Noman: "Pakistan already made a failed attempt on bowling first on a moist wicket against Australia, they have repeated it again knowing that they dont have the bowlers who can make use of such situation. On the other hand, Aamir will now be under immense pressure to avoid another warning and may not be able to deliver as planned..." But early for all this, I think. There's rain to come, and DLS very likely to play a part.

4161,1stInnings$7.6
4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Sharma, FOUR runs, ahhh, and that was a poor delivery! Almost a chance for fine leg, though. Short and on the body. Helped away by the batsman, and only just evades the leap from the man and fine leg before it speeds away to the boundary. India are beginning to motor now
4161,1stInnings$8.1

4161,1stInnings$1
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Rahul, 1 run, what has Pakistan done?!! That was a clear as day run out opportunity. Rohit came through for two when it never was on, and the outfielder throws to the wrong end. Sarfaraz is fuming. Pakistan have missed a massive chance here
4161,1stInnings$"Have to credit Sharma for this. He's usually a slow starter but considering the possibility of rain and DLS later in the game, he has already upped his tempo. Great attitude from a great player. A fan from Pakistan " He is a special talent, isn't he? Pakistan must already be wary of what's to follow

Gentle dab into the off side, he wanted a single, Rohit responded late and wasn't even in the frame. Shadab did superbly well to pick up the ball one-hand but got the direction of the throw wrong. He was completely off balance.

4161,1stInnings$40.3
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, no run, slower delivery, gets the edge, but the lack of pace means it doesn't carry to Sarfaraz. Pandya got lucky there
4161,1stInnings$40.4
4161,1stInnings$1
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, 1 run, full. Pandya helicopters it to fine leg. If that shot begins to fire, watch out Pakistan

4161,1stInnings$2
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, 2 runs, slower ball, jabbed into the onside. The lack of pace on the ball allows the pair to scuttle through for two, and let's face it, Pakistan's fielders aren't gonna stop them

4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Kohli, FOUR runs, lovely pick-up, is that the shot of the day? Hung back, and the fuller ball was there to drive on the up. Leans into it on the front foot, and lofts over mid-on. Don't bother running
4161,1stInnings$Hus Silverado: "India are playing here with the same pattern as against Australia in the last match and are looking good for a 350+ score..Just hoping that Kohli accelerates better this time and gets his Hundred No.42 !!!" India seem to have a formula they follow very well

4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, SIX runs, what was that? A slower ball from Hasan that beat Pandya all ends up. It takes his top edge and flies through over the keeper, all the way!
4161,1stInnings$42.3
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, no run, deceived again by the slower ball, beaten completely. Excellent stuff from Hasan. He has been a little unlucky today on a number of occasions
4161,1stInnings$42.4
4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, FOUR runs, and just as I say that, he sends down absolute filth. Rubbish line, way down legside, and a full toss. You don't need to be Pandya to whip that to fine leg for four, but that;s what he did
4161,1stInnings$42.5
4161,1stInnings$0
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, no run, and he's back to the good stuff from Hasan. Tight line, and it's too close for the cut that Pandya's attempting. 11 off the over but it hasn't been too bad from the poor bowler
4161,1stInnings$42.6
4161,1stInnings$2
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Pandya, 2 runs, slower ball, guided down to cow corner from Pandya. The pair run two once more. 13 from that over, which rather neatly encapsulates how unlucky Hasan has been there
4161,1stInnings$43.1
4161,1stInnings$2
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Kohli, 2 runs, slower ball to start off, Kohli flicks it and absolutely dashes back for two. The throw is a little too inaccurate, and that gives the Indian captain his second consecutive half century
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir is back into the attack, with four overs to go. He should bowl through now

4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Pandya, FOUR runs, pulverised by Pandya! Slower ball, and the batsman steps into position and absolutely bludgeons this through cover. No chance for any of the fielders, and this is dangerous for Pakistan now
4161,1stInnings$43.5
4161,1stInnings$W
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Pandya, OUT, and gone! Stunned silence from three fourths of the crowd. Helicopter shot from Pandya again, and it found the middle of his bat, but just didn't quite have the power to clear Babar Azam at long-on. Massive breakthrough for Pakistan

4161,1stInnings$44.3
4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Kohli, FOUR runs, another ball that's tossed down legside. There was swing there, but down the wrong line, it's useless. Another easy flick to the fine leg boundary
4161,1stInnings$44.4
4161,1stInnings$2
4161,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Kohli, 2 runs, slow waist height delivery, Kohli smacks it to midwicket, where a diving Imam prevents another four

4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Shankar, no run, and he's gone, is he? Full and wide, and Shankar edges it to Sarfaraz. A big appeal, and the umpire rules it out. Reviewed immediately. The review shows a clear gap between bat and ball. Decision overturned
4161,1stInnings$Saad: "High pressure game for Shankar. You may argue India should have used DK for that extra experience."

4161,1stInnings$1
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Shankar, 1 run, scooped up into the covers, and Shankar gets Kohli on strike for the final ball of the 47th
4161,1stInnings$Right, we're moments away from a resumption. Welcome back, folks
4161,1stInnings$Saurav, a Manchester local, with a dire message: "Rain started in Cheadle again (we get weather first, then it moves to Old Trafford which is just a few miles away)" -- Anyway, the players are walking out and Danyal is back to see off this innings.
4161,1stInnings$Shankar (not Vijay) says: "Would be interesting to see how this break in play will pan out -- refreshed legs going in full blast or taking away the momentum from the intensity that was built up for the last 5 overs."
4161,1stInnings$2.30pm The hover cover is coming off. We aren't far from a resumption. The umpires are checking a few patches inside the 30-yard circle. The stumps have been put in too. Full game. On. Start at 2.40pm. Mid-innings break of 15 minutes. No overs lost.
4161,1stInnings$More reading, fun reading. We asked a selection of former cricketers, writers and senior journalists to pick their favourites from the opposition camp. You may or may not come out surprised.
4161,1stInnings$A lot of you asking about revised targets, this is an excellent primer on how the DLS method works. Answers most of your questions.
4161,1stInnings$Here's a clip of Kohli's innings for readers in India, from Hotstar. Reckon he can make a dash towards a century when play resumes?
4161,1stInnings$2.10pm The square covers are being peeled off. Only the covers on the 22-yards and the run-ups on either side remain. The floodlights are starting to take effect.
4161,1stInnings$Sampad : "I'm not in Manchester, But I'm keeping an eye by Manchester Airport Webcam. And its looking sunny near the Airport. "
4161,1stInnings$Ram Kamboz: "This is just a shout out to Cricinfo....I have followed Cricinfo for at least 12+ years and you have kept me entertained whilst in the office and at home throughout many tournaments, no matter if it's a test match, t20 or an ODI. Humorous and Entertaining. Keep up the good work." -- Thank you. Readers like you make us what we are.
4161,1stInnings$2.06pm Thanks, Danyal. Rain dance? What's that. I live in the era of the Naagin dance. The rain is easing off. We shouldn't be far from a resumption. The sun has decided to make another guest appearance.
4161,1stInnings$One way for Rohit fans - or just cricket fans - (in India) to pass the rain break: watch highlights of his innings, on Hotstar
4161,1stInnings$Right, to do the rain dance, now, here's Shashank.
4161,1stInnings$For all of you wondering, if Pakistan have a 20-over chase, the target will be 184
4161,1stInnings$Omkar: "If India don't get to bat again how much has Dhoni's wicket cost India?" Not much, it would appear. With Dhoni, the target would have been 328 in 46 for Pakistan.
4161,1stInnings$So if India don't bat again, Pakistan will have to chase 327 in 46 overs. That's all for later, however.
4161,1stInnings$Behram Ishfaq: "How heavy is the rain? Is it pouring or is it just some light drizzle?" It's a drizzle, but it's expected to get heavier at some point. We're supposed to have dry spells, to, though. So let's wait and see
4161,1stInnings$and the players are walking off. The rain has arrived!
4161,1stInnings$So while India bossed this innings, perhaps the rain came at just the wrong time for Pakistan, who would have had ideas about curtailing India below 330.
4161,1stInnings$Anshit: "Can they take innings break's time gap right now just like in tests, tea or lunch is taken early because of rain?" They could, but we don't start losing overs for another 75 minutes
4161,1stInnings$46.6
4161,1stInnings$1w
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Kohli, 1 wide, given a wide. Slower bouncer, and the umpire thinks it's above Kohli's head

4161,1stInnings$4
4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Kohli, FOUR runs, so delicately done! Kohli uses the pace of the ball and guides it between the keeper and third man. Slower ball, but it still trickles all the way for four

4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Kohli, 2 runs, square cuts the slower ball, and it requires sharp work at deep extra to cut it off

4161,1stInnings$W
4161,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Kohli, OUT, gone, is he? Pakistan have Kohli! Quick bouncer, too quick for Kohli, who tried to swivel and pull it to fine leg. Gets the faintest of edges, and a prolonged appeal moves the umpire's finger

4161,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Jadhav, 1 wide, that's Wahab at his worst. Wide and wild, Sarfaraz does well to keep it from going for five wides. Needs to keep it tight
4161,1stInnings$Ribhav Bansal: "This innings of Vijay Shankar is painfully reminding me of his struggle against Mustafizur's left arm cutters in the Nidahas final. He was supposed to give strike to Kohli. Instead, him missing balls unnecessarily put pressure on Kohli."

4161,2ndInnings$Bhuvneshwar Kumar has the new ball. Imam is on strike. Two slips in place for him.
4161,2ndInnings$3.30pm Play to resume as the hover cover has been taken off. Out come the openers. The stumps are being put in. Let's get on with it. There is some blue in the distance, even though a heavy cloud hangs over. Hopefully it will blow over.
4161,2ndInnings$Pakistan's 20-over target: 97/0, 109/1, 125/2 or 146/3. This is if play stops exactly after 20 overs. As a chasing side, approaching this with one eye on the forecast can be mighty difficult. Do you preserve wickets, do you go for the dash and risk losing a wicket or two?
4161,2ndInnings$3.24pm The drizzle has gotten heavier and the players are walking off again. I'm not kidding. The sun is out but it's also drizzling at the same time. The main hover cover comes on. The Indian players have huddled together in the middle. The Pakistan openers are besides the sightscreen.
4161,2ndInnings$3.19pm Restart in six minutes. No overs lost. As a side, it will be interesting to see Pakistan's approach. Do they play for a 20-over target? Surely they should plan to not be more than one wicket down at the end of 20 overs, which will then constitute a game.
4161,2ndInnings$3.13pm The umpires are walking out for a mini inspection of sorts. The main hover cover hasn't been completely taken off. This can really be annoying. Erasmus is having a look at his clock and chats with the chief of the ground staff, who signals to them that he's possibly worried about the clouds from the west. (Looks dark, trust me). They know where the rain comes from. So we won't have a resumption just yet. The ropes have been brought out to mop up water on the surface.
4161,2ndInnings$3.09pm The weather seems to have cleared, at least the big cloud right over the ground has. The sun is peeking out, the covers are going off. But on either side of the stands, there are some dark clouds. Which really won't take long to come in. For the moment, it's dry. Let's hope it stays that way.

Massive break for India from an unlikely source. This is bowled full, swung back in a hint, but the doubt remains. Did it pitch outside leg? Could Pakistan have reviewed? Will need a replay to confirm everything, but what is confirmed is Pakistan have lost their first wicket.

4161,2ndInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Babar Azam, OUT, through the gate! Incredible delivery from a supremely talented bowler. Everything about this delivery is the kind of stuff dreams are made of for a left-arm wristspinner. Nicely tossed up, the ball drifts away gently across Babar, pitches and then wickedly spins back in. Babar is looking to get outside the line to block, but is completely deceived by the dip, and then because he's played down the wrong line with a bit of gap between bat and pad, there's no second line of defence. Babar was worried about the wrong'un. Sneaks through the gap, clean bowled. Wow, what a ball. Magnificent.

4161,2ndInnings$6.52pm Live visuals from Manchester has Kohli chilling in the dressing room. He exudes the body language of someone who knows there's little chance of a resumption. Some of the players have changed into their training gear. Is that a sign?
4161,2ndInnings$Kartik: "Vijay Shankar's dibbly-dobblies warrant selection for the rest of the WC. Remember exactly how India won the 1983 WC. I see a Madan Lal/Binny/Amarnath element to Vijay Shankar's bowling. " -- I wonder if you've seen a lot of the 1983 film's build up. haha
4161,2ndInnings$6.45pm Good news, or is it? The covers are coming off. But that doesn't necessarily mean chances of play has brightened. They need time to take the covers off, which I find strange. Sometimes, it's almost as if they've taken longer to peel the covers off than the time play has been held up because of the drizzle.
4161,2ndInnings$We could be down to a few minutes before a final call. This is all but over. The crowd has thinned, the hover covers are on, it's dark and gloomy overhead.

4161,2ndInnings$06:35pm The rain has relented somewhat, but the covers remain in place for now. Even if they get them off, it might be hard to get play started before the cut-off time.
4161,2ndInnings$06:30pm Cut-off time, for those asking, is 19:15, which is 45 minutes from now
4161,2ndInnings$Abhishek: "Is there any chance for Pakistan, in case rain stops, coz I would have loved seeing a bit of a fight from here on, maybe a Pandyaesque innings to get them near 250-270...would have made things interesting, but other than that, hats off to Men in Blue, a near perfect outing, just hope Bhuvi's Ok, coz, his injury would cause selection headaches, more for his batting at no 8." I don't know what's less likely, the rain relenting or the Pak lower order showing fight from this situation.
4161,2ndInnings$Hammad Afzal: "What disappointment this turned out to be! From golden age of Pakistan cricket when Pakistan used to be the Asian powerhouse of cricket we have come to a time where India is so far ahead that these two teams simply do not constitute a contest anymore, let alone the greatest rivalry in world cricket!"
4161,2ndInnings$06:20pm Right, so rain has stopped play, and India will win by 86 runs should play not resume. We will keep you updated, and be back should we have further information.
