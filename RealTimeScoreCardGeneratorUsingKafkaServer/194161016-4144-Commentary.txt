4144,1stInnings$Thomas to Babar Azam, OUT, brilliant catch by Shai Hope He's sprouted wings and flown to his right - and I mean flown because he was airborne and parallel to the ground - to pull off a stunner. That earlier drop isn't going to cost West Indies much after all. Outswinger that was going away from him, Babar had a somewhat lazy waft at it and took a thick edge. Should have ordinarily gone between keeper and slip, or been parried to the ground. Until Hope took off.
