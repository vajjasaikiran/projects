4145,1stInnings$Henry to Thirimanne, FOUR runs, away with a leg glance! Easy pickings. Couldn't have asked for an easier first ball. Loose, down leg and he simply stands tall and tickles it fine.
4145,1stInnings$Karunaratne and Thirimanne have a task at hand. To weather this storm with the new ball. On a green top. Can the openers get past the Henry-Boult spell? Two slips in place for Henry. Let's go

4145,1stInnings$Henry to Thirimanne, OUT, huge appeal. I mean a really huge appeal. Plays all around a full delivery and is struck on the pad. Only doubt was did it pitch outside leg. . The answer is an emphatic no. Williamson goes for a review. Pitching in line, impact in line, hitting. Three reds, so he will have to walk back. What a review! Thirimanne is gone.

4145,1stInnings$Adarsh: "The pitches have been very interesting so far. Something for the seamers early in the day, the batsman who adapt and survive can score easily later, and some turn for the spinners in the latter half." -- As it should be. Hope I don't have to see a 400 v 400 this World Cup.

Went really high, looks like this full delivery held up just a touch more on the surface, Kusal looking to belt it down the ground but got hit a touch high on the bat, which is why there was no timing. Sri Lanka lose their second and it's a big wicket.

4145,1stInnings$1
4145,1stInnings$Ferguson to Karunaratne, 1 run, outstanding from Santner at deep square! Or has he taken it cleanly? They're going upstairs. Not out comes the decision because replays inconclusive. The soft-signal was not-out too. Dimuth makes room to slap this but the bowler follows him, so now he decides to take on the short ball and pull, no timing and gets it high on the bat. Santner anticipates the stroke and runs in quickly and as this descends, put in a full-length dive to complete the catch. The on-field umpires went upstairs to check if this was a bump ball. They clearly felt there was some part of the ball touching the ground.

4145,2ndInnings$Shubham: "Too early to start worrying. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan were expected to be the bottom two teams in the tournament. Pakistan have always been unpredictable and could come back next game looking like the best in the world. So, the only disappointment till now has been ENG v. SA not going down to the wire. Calm down people."

4145,2ndInnings$John: "Seems funny that England made what seemed like a string statement in the first game and yet look like being in no better than third place and possibly in fourth after tonight. There's a long way to go, of course, and you'd say that SA were almost certainly the strongest of the losing sides in the first four games. That holds true if Australia defeat Afghanistan and possibly even if they don't."
