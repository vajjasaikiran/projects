4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Vince, no run, wide of the crease and pushed in at middle at a good length. Some drift in. Vince watchful as he taps this down the pitch

4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Vince, 2 runs, length and drifted onto the pads this time, and flicked to deep square's left

4163,1stInnings$2
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Vince, 2 runs, full and in at leg stump again. Reaches out and whips firmly to long-on's right and there's that sharp running again
4163,1stInnings$0.5
4163,1stInnings$0
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Vince, no run, past the outside edge. Drags the length shorter this time but enough on the trajectory to still draw him forward for the block. Then rips it past the edge

4163,1stInnings$4
4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, FOUR runs, yes, James. Plants a half stride forward as Dawlat smashes this into the turf, short of a length again. Outside off this time but he pulls sweetly to the square leg fence

4163,1stInnings$1
4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, 1 run, misfield at mid-on. Length and slanted in at the stumps. Punched on the up to Asghar's left and he fumbles before he tumbles
4163,1stInnings$Mike H: "Might it not have been a good idea for England to rest Morgan, given the back spasm? Rest up a bit more, let things settle down, and come back for SL? No disrespect to AFG, as they're my 2nd team!"

4163,1stInnings$3
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Bairstow, 3 runs, another misfield, this time at mid-off. And this time it costs them two. Length outside off and he reaches out to drill this. A slide from the fielder to his left, but this seeps through

4163,1stInnings$4
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Bairstow, FOUR runs, gets it past mid-off. Nicely done from Bairstow,good low hands. Full outside off, allows it to land and gets his weight into this drive
4163,1stInnings$4.4
4163,1stInnings$1
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Bairstow, 1 run, length on middle stump, plants the front leg across, flicks to short fine's left

4163,1stInnings$4.5
4163,1stInnings$0
4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Vince, no run, short of a length just outside off. Vince has seemingly defended for the one that comes in. This one goes away. Short enough to evade trouble though, it's defended down the pitch

4163,1stInnings$4
4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Bairstow, FOUR runs, not fully in control of this pull, but hit well enough in the end. Some shape in from a good length. Gets on the front foot and gets it high on the bat. It bounces past midwicket and there's no stopping it after that

4163,1stInnings$5.4
4163,1stInnings$4
4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, FOUR runs, swats at this. And gets enough to beat mid-off to his right. Completely out of shape as he hits this. A bit of a walk down and he wants to go on the rise, over the bowler. It hurries him and he can't get a swing through the line. A feeble chip, it appears, but mid-off's not chasing it down
4163,1stInnings$5.5

4163,1stInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Bairstow, no run, withdraws from the pull as this turns away. Once again, he has not picked the variation. Shapes to pull and just ends up embarrassingly far away from this in the end

4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, FOUR runs, chipped over the bowler. In control this time and good connection. Length at off stump, keeps the front leg out of the way and creates room to bring a straight bat from under to launch this

4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, 2 runs, misfield again. Third today, from my count. Length outside off, punched with an angled bat, straight to cover, who fails to get down in time
4163,1stInnings$7.5
4163,1stInnings$2
4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, 2 runs, misjudged at deep square! Vince survives. A mistimed pull, sliced right off the low part of the bat. Hangs invitingly up for Nabi who seems to have thought this was hit harder - he runs along the perimeter rather than in. It's too late by the time he realises. The ball plonks into the turf to his left

Leave Vince to #3 where he then has more license to go for it." --- I'd argue that Vince is a specialist opener in this format and Root a specialist No. 3. Also that everyone in this England team has that license at any given time

4163,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Vince, OUT, not anymore! Vince's adventurous pulling has finally cost him. Short in the corridor, on the front foot to pull this. Looks like a top edge onto his helmet that lobs up for short fine leg. He holds his shape under it and takes it easily. Dawlat's persistence pays off. Vince's scratchy stay is over

4163,1stInnings$Seth Miller: "I hereby petition to change Naib's tag from rmf to rvvs (right arm very very slow). I mean seriously a seamer bowling a ball at 100 kph!!" --- I'm all for it! (His pace and the designation)

4163,2ndInnings$2:06pm Well, here it is. The kind of innings that was expected every other day this World Cup. It's taken a few weeks, but boy, if you needed anything to shake you out from the funk of all the rain delays, this did it. 142 runs in the last ten overs. That's how many England got. Morgan, dropped on 28, made 120 off his next 45 balls. He hit 17 sixes, the most by any batsman in an ODI, and fueled another record - most sixes by any team in an ODI. England held that previously with 24. They've hit 25 today. Eleven of those came off Rashid's bowling - yet another six-related record as he got the worst figures in a World Cup. that is the story of the innings. Just some unreal hitting from a team that was going at just above 5 for a big part of the innings. Root with neat little 88 to support Morgan, and Bairstow before him, who made 90, would have been the stars on a normal ODI day. We are beyond normal now. The chase shortly.

Done by the slower ball, moving across and attempting something cute, by the time he realised the ball was arriving late he was in no position to hit it... Superb knock from Afghanistan's No. 4, though. Kept his team above water

4163,2ndInnings$6.35pm: Okay, that's your lot for this one. Sheriff Morgan and his six-shooter laid down the law at Old Trafford today, and sent his team riding off into the sunset with the points. Afghanistan battled admirably, and have some plusses to take into their next match against India (gulp!), but this was as comprehensive as results come. We'll have Danyal's report on the site soon, and join us again tomorrow for a real crunch clash, New Zealand v South Africa at Edgbaston, a game around which the whole tournament could pivot. From myself, Varun and Thilak, it's goodbye for now!
4163,2ndInnings$6.25pm: Time for the captains, starting with Gulbadin Naib: "Yeah, obviously how they played, [Morgan's was] one of the best innings I ever seen. Our plan when we saw the wicket, different to the last four games, it suited the spinners and Mujeeb did a good job. Unfortunately Rashid was expensive, not at his best, so England scored around 400. We did a lot of good things but we dropped Morgan, so this is the main point for us. We work hard in every department and are improving day by day, but we have work to do. [Attempting to chase?] Big target but our message was play your normal game, don't think about win or lose, play the 50 overs. Maybe we then have a chance. We played 50 overs, so that's a good thing for our batters."
4163,2ndInnings$Morgan is back for more: "Our next two three games are crucial. Want to bring our intensity to every game, we were at the top of four game today. If we can bring that to Headingley against Sri Lanka, then we go on to play Australia in good form. I think the intensity can still be there, you can still produce mistakes. [Dropped catches?] We did spill a couple of catches, which can happen, hopefully it doesn't continue. But I can't fault the guys. [Archer and Wood?] Throw Stokes in there, bowling 90mph as well as the moment. Having guys competing that level is amazing."
4163,2ndInnings$6.15pm: England go top of the table, while Afghanistan stay rooted to the bottom. There was a mini pitch invasion at the end there, with one Afghan fan taking a selfie with some of the England players, apparently. They are just happy to be there - and happy their side batted through a full 50 overs, which is a decent milestone for them, giving they had a snowball's chance in hell of making 398. It was a decent outing for the England captain, too, amid a record-breaking deluge of sixes - fittingly, Morgan's 148 was pretty much the margin between the sides.
4163,2ndInnings$For that knock, Eoin Morgan is named Man of the Match: "Today was a fantastic day for us, and I managed to have a day out, which was great,. The wicket was good, we bowled well in the first ten overs, our openers batted really. A good day all round. I didn't think it was going to be my day. Hobbling around with a bad back, didn't think I'd produce an innings like that. Makes it a bit more special when i can compete with the youngsters in the side. It was nice. It started out as a tough game, Afghanistan are a side with potential, so it's nice to do it on the big stage. [Used to play more funky shots?] I think I have changed, everybody plays the shots I started my career with, so that they're not as effective. I'm probably stronger down the ground now than I ever have been. [Back okay now?] Yeah, tomorrow's going to be a rough day."
