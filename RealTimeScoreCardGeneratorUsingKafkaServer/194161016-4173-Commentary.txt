Their last three matches are virtual must-wins against the three best teams if they are to make it to the knockouts - an objective which the ECB has invested a lot in fulfilling (while also sacrificing their overall domestic structure's stability). The following three matches might just be the most important in their history..." They've not yet been at the races today, have they? At least, not since a few nibbled off the seam in the first over

4173,1stInnings$Ali to Warner, OUT, Warner's gone! This is a massive breakthrough for England, a bit of extra kick outside off, and Root at backward point snaffles a llimp uppish punch off the back foot. Suckered off the pitch, and startled mid-stroke, but that's been an brilliant start for Australia

4173,1stInnings$Ali to Khawaja, 1 run, eased down to long off to get off the mark
4173,1stInnings$Right, Khawaja enters the fray. Can England turn the screw with the dangerman gone?

4173,1stInnings$Moeen and Rashid have both got Finch four times each in ODIs ... wonder if England will be tempted to stick with spin for a bit longer? Indeed they will
4173,1stInnings$23.2
4173,1stInnings$1
4173,1stInnings$Rashid to Finch, 1 run, leg-sided, a bit of a poor ball, but gets away with it as Finch scuffs his urgent pull to the man on the 45

4173,1stInnings$Farhan: "Conceding 300+ is a recent norm for England, they won't get worried until a batting collapse happens." The conditions are set to brighten up this afternoon. But Starc and co will be watching the lengths with intent
4173,1stInnings$23.5
4173,1stInnings$2
4173,1stInnings$Rashid to Khawaja, 2 runs, down on one knee for the sweep, and Woakes scuttles round to gather

But after Sri Lanka mach every this has Changed and all of a sudden England is not the same team. Their accurate bowlers struggling to ball well on a bowling pitch . Did Sri Lanka change England luck ?" We shall see ... they haven't completely forgotten how to bat!

4173,1stInnings$Ali to Finch, no run, a drag-down from Moeen as he ramps up the pace, a flat-batted pull round the corner, contact at ankle height, but Root does well to intercept behind square

4173,1stInnings$6
4173,1stInnings$Ali to Finch, SIX runs, pounded majestically over long-on! Woakes was back on the rope but that was belligerently nailed, leaning back, short arms, full power, pounded out of the arc and over the rope!
4173,1stInnings$25.1

4173,1stInnings$25.3
4173,1stInnings$1

4173,1stInnings$2
4173,1stInnings$Rashid to Finch, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, met on the full with a toe-ended drive to deep cover. There's a modicum of control in the innings at the moment, but England are still staring down a massive chase

4173,1stInnings$27.1
4173,1stInnings$0
4173,1stInnings$Rashid to Khawaja, no run, missed stumping! A perfect googly, tweaks past the edge as the back foot slides out of the crease, and Buttler's iron gloves strike!

4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Khawaja, 1 run, too short from Stokes, but Khawaja can't time his pull from outside off, mid-on gathers as they pinch the single

4173,1stInnings$Omair: "Butler has been missing a lot of chances. Why not keep wickets with Johnny Bairstow?" Continuity I guess ... but it does seem increasingly perverse now that he is a regular pick in the white-ball team
4173,1stInnings$28.5
4173,1stInnings$0
4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Finch, no run, beauty! Good full length, and massive jag off the seam as Finch is turned inside out. Comprehensively beaten
4173,1stInnings$Some more sawdust on the footholes... England have seemed bothered by the landing areas today, a touch damp

4173,1stInnings$0
4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Finch, no run, well bowled, another cutter, taking pace off the ball on a full length, and Finch adjusts well at the last split-second
4173,1stInnings$30.6
4173,1stInnings$0
4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Finch, no run, bouncer! Good wheels as Finch swings into a pull but the ball is already long gone. Another decent over, but there's no real danger of a breakthrough
4173,1stInnings$31.1
4173,1stInnings$2

4173,1stInnings$31.6
4173,1stInnings$0

4173,1stInnings$And now, here come the boos ... it's Steve Smith! A pretty foreboding atmosphere, with Smoke on the Water belting out against a baseline of crowd abuse ... this match might suddenly be heading up a gear ...
4173,1stInnings$32.4
4173,1stInnings$1
4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Smith, 1 run, a flashing drive into the off side, urgent bat on ball already from Smith

4173,1stInnings$32.6
4173,1stInnings$0
4173,1stInnings$Stokes to Smith, no run, flinched to the leg side, a fine over from Stokes. A glimmer from England in a strangely subdued display

Why doesn't Smith promote himself to 3 in such a situation to let Maxwell come in at 4 and cash in on the opening!" Australia are two-down with 17 overs to make hay. I see no problem here

4173,2ndInnings$2.33pm So, out come England's openers, Jonny Bairstow and James Vince. Mitchell Starc, Australia's primary menace, was feeling his hamstring when batting at the end of their innings ... he's not taking the newest of new balls ... Jason Behrendorff has first dibs. Interesting...
4173,2ndInnings$2.28pm Well hello again. Are you ready for the showdown? England's target is 286 - perhaps 40 runs fewer than Australia would have anticipated after 30 overs, and meat and drink for a side that has been putting 300 on the board for fun in this tournament ... until of course that nerve-shattering implosion against Sri Lanka last week ... is today redemption day, or the beginning of the end? If Australia can hold out, they will be through to the semi-finals. It's all to play for!
4173,2ndInnings$Match Coverage
4173,2ndInnings$Michael Hussey, Graeme Swann and Murali Kartik give their thoughts on Australia's total on the live show. Andrew Miller will be back to start the chase in a little while.
4173,2ndInnings$Innings break 2.05pm Alex Carey's late flourish gives Australia something to bowl at. They made a mess of an outstanding start. Aaron Finch and David Warner were superb up front on a difficult pitch but neither could kick on to a big score. Finch got out for exactly 100. Warner made 53 and then the side fell away from there.
4173,2ndInnings$Aaron Finch: "It would have been nice to go on with it. It's never ideal to get a hundred and then get out. There's still enough in the wicket though. That's a pretty good score. It wasn't the easiest wicket to start on, the ball was seaming. We were conscious to try and get through that with as little damage as possible and we were able to do that. We got ourselves into a decent position. We could have got a few more runs."
4173,2ndInnings$Nisar: "Fine cameo from Alex Carey to avoid a complete shutdown towards the end there from Australia."
4173,2ndInnings$Yash: "Finch and Warner score at less than run a ball and couldn't capitalise after reaching the milestones. 9 think it worked in favour of England as the likes of Maxwell Stoinis and Carey didn't get enough time . But nonetheless a decent total. Should be an interest chase. "

4173,2ndInnings$Behrendorff to Woakes, OUT, a massive wipe over the leg side, but what a catch! Woakes thought he had nailed it, in the arc, a huge heave, but Maxwell tracked back on the edge of the rope, hopped to pouch the ball high above his head, then, cool as you like, lobbed it back to the waiting Finch to complete a routine relay! England, as if you didn't already know it, are sunk without trace in this one!
