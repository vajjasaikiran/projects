4183,1stInnings$4b
4183,1stInnings$Santner to Roy, 4 byes, nearly bowled him but it's four byes! An arm ball first up, he went back to cut but misread the seam up, it swung in sharply beat the inside edge and just went past leg stump and Latham missed it!

4183,1stInnings$4
4183,1stInnings$Santner to Roy, FOUR runs, a full toss and he leans on a cover-drive, placing it in the gap! A gift from Santner and Roy takes advantage

4183,1stInnings$Santner to Roy, no run, looped up higher and slower, he pushes on the front foot to cover-point

4183,1stInnings$1.1
4183,1stInnings$0
4183,1stInnings$Boult to Roy, no run, hit on the pad but outside leg. There's shape in first up, nipping back and hitting the pad high
4183,1stInnings$Trent Boult has the other new ball. Australia's two left arm quicks took nine wickets against England.

4183,1stInnings$    Mitchell Santner1-0-5-0
4183,1stInnings$Anurag Bhide: "Shouldn't Santner be signalling to the keeper that its going to be the arm ball, to prevent instances like those 4 byes first up? Seems like the keeper was expecting it to grip as well" Not sure Latham expected it to swing that far. It went a fair way in the air
4183,1stInnings$1.2
4183,1stInnings$0
4183,1stInnings$Boult to Roy, no run, more swing down leg, it clips the pad and goes through to Latham. There's an appeal but it clearly came off pad

4183,1stInnings$0
4183,1stInnings$Southee to Bairstow, no run, 134kph, shorter length outside off, he's up on his toes and knocking this down off the back foot
4183,1stInnings$Remarkable that this is Southee's first ODI since February, and only his fifth of 2019. Even more remarkable, given that he took 6 for 65 in that outing against Bangladesh! here he is. His first game of any description since the warm up game against India

4183,1stInnings$NK: "With almost getting a second life at the first ball itself, I foresee Roy getting to three figures. What's your opinion Alex?" Roy has scored 13 scores of 50 or more in ODI's since September 2017 and England have won all 13 games. He is very important.

4183,1stInnings$Southee to Bairstow, FOUR runs, glorious back foot drive through cover! It was just short of a length outside off, he stood up and cracked it through extra cover with a vertical bat. Great timing
4183,1stInnings$2.4
4183,1stInnings$4
4183,1stInnings$Southee to Bairstow, FOUR runs, square drive in the air but in the gap! It was a length ball, wide, he threw his hands through it and hit it chest high through cover-point but dissected the fielders in the ring and it ran away

4183,1stInnings$2.6
4183,1stInnings$2
4183,1stInnings$Southee to Bairstow, 2 runs, an edge but it runs safely well wide of first slip, it would have been wide of second, third man has to run around from a wide position to cut it off. That was a good length and line, forcing a defensive prod

4183,1stInnings$Boult to Roy, 4 leg byes, 133kph, swinging down leg and it comes off pad and runs fine. Too straight, shaping down leg and Roy will be annoyed he didn't get bat on it. The team gets four anyway

4183,1stInnings$Incidentally, my Camel CC team mate Brendon (a Kiwi though he disguises it well...) has seen a certain similarity in approach between Jason Roy and Nathan Astle. Lots of clean thwacking through the arc and all that. Astle's World Cup record, however, was truly weird. It started so well, in the very first match of England's two-decade-long stint of World Cup uselessness, but it rather petered out thereafter...

4183,1stInnings$18.3
4183,1stInnings$4
4183,1stInnings$Neesham to Roy, FOUR runs, majestic power and poise! But that's hare-brained bowling, far too short from Neesham, far too wide as well, Roy rocks back and plunders it through midwicket!

4183,1stInnings$W
4183,1stInnings$Neesham to Roy, OUT, it was all a set-up after all! Fuller, straighter, Roy has punched this on the up, no footwork this time, and short cover has snaffled a dolly! The much-needed opening has been prised... Roy is aghast. He had the bowling at his mercy!

4183,1stInnings$2

4183,1stInnings$Vikas: "Lot of opinions about this England team and almost every team seems to forget that this very team won a lot of bilateral series outside England over the last 4 years. I'm pretty sure, all the other boards were not kind enough to prepare flat tracks for England's liking.

4183,1stInnings$Ramble: "As per Jarrod Kimber's article about left/right combinations, Santner bowls better to left handers, but has been held back from bowling to them by Williamson bowling himself, according to T20 wisdom about the ball spinning away from the bat. A good chance for Kane to try out Kimber's research?" If they had come in early, prior to the 30th he might have. I doubt it now. Maybe one or two when five men are allowed out.

Not that they have a team of ultra aggressive batsmen who often fail in trying conditions, or an attack that is picked as much on its batting ability as it's inability to keep decent sides under 300, or that Australia actually outplayed them, or that England have failed in every major tournament for eons. Let's just stick with the bad luck theory....." Never said that. They were thoroughly outplayed by Australia. Their poor lengths allowed the Australian openers to have some luck.

4183,2ndInnings$2.45pm Hello again ... well, This Is On once more ... in not dissimilar scenes to the first innings against India on Sunday, England pounded out of the blocks, slowed to a crawl, then hauled themselves back to a strong position with something of a late revival. A target of 306 is considerably less than they looked like posting, but it's still a tough task in the context of this World Cup...

4183,2ndInnings$Streaker alert! It's come to this now ... A distant pimply dot of wobbly human can be seen cavorting across the grass as the stewards give chase ... "stark naked ... just a green wig He has had a chat with Latham and Santner," says Sidharth Monga. "He has done a cartwheel now on the square..." Scenes!
4183,2ndInnings$"Sri Lankan groundstaff would have shot him with a tranquiliser dart and bagged him within seconds," adds Andrew Fernando, who never misses a chance to trumpet their superior readiness for action!
4183,2ndInnings$"It has taken seven men to take him off," adds Monga. As pointless action-seeking goes, that's quite impressive. Next!
