Khawaja-Warner is the best Opening pair for Aussies but think Finch is being a bit selfish here and using his captaincy to choose his favourite slot. He's not in his best form and the cant score against quality bowling with the new ball. I expect Langer and Ponting to explain this to him !!" If there's one thing you can't accuse Aaron Finch of, it is selfishness. He will do whatever is best for the team including dropping himself. Langer and Ponting are backing him in. But it will become a concern if he can't get some runs.

It was full and angled into Carey, who is forced into playing at the ball for the first time. Beaten playing around his pad and struck on off stump at first view. Indeed it's a red light on impact but he's hit just above the knee roll and ball-tracking shows Brathwaite's height generates enough bounce to clear the stumps by two inches. West Indies lose their review. Umpire Chris Gaffaney's sharp decision is upheld.

4152,1stInnings$Thomas to Carey, FOUR runs, tight! But a controlled shot to be fair and clears gully by two yards. Thomas short of a length on off, Carey buckled his knees to create room to elevate this ball and just undercuts it enough for his first boundary

4152,1stInnings$0
4152,1stInnings$Thomas to Carey, no run, bouncer on fourth stump, left alone.
4152,1stInnings$22.5
4152,1stInnings$4
4152,1stInnings$Thomas to Carey, FOUR runs, surviving dangerously yet again! Full on off stump, Carey doesn't get over the top of a drive toward mid-off, it carried for the longest time before bouncing just short of Holder at mid-off before going under his slide on the ring and it skids away.
4152,1stInnings$22.6
4152,1stInnings$1

4152,1stInnings$23.3
4152,1stInnings$4
4152,1stInnings$Cottrell to Carey, FOUR runs, carbon copy ball and nearly identical placement. Carey gets over the top of this one a bit more and hits it a touch squarer too in the air over point, still nowhere near the off side ring. Cottrell releasing the pressure here.

4152,1stInnings$4
4152,1stInnings$Cottrell to Carey, FOUR runs, overpitched outside off, leans into a drive, all timing along the ground through cover. A trifecta of boundaries for Carey in the over to make up for a very timid start.
4152,1stInnings$24.1
4152,1stInnings$4
4152,1stInnings$Holder to Smith, FOUR runs, dropped! Cottrell eaten by the turf trolls on the boundary! Holder bounces Smith and he can't control this hook as it sails toward long leg. Cottrell circles around running 20 yards left but takes a very poor angle and is on the verge of over-running the chance. He tries to change direction late and loses his footing with a clumsy slip and slide. The ball lands a foot in front of him grasping forward in vain. Should've gotten two hands to it at the very least. Smith survives!
4152,1stInnings$Holder switching ends again.

4152,1stInnings$Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs, dropped! Very harsh but it did ricochet off Brathwaite's hand at deep square leg and then hit the rope on the full for six. Shortish length on off stump, Coulter-Nile laces a scorching pull toward Brathwaite at deep square leg, just evades his grasp running to his left and sliding at the last moment. After the take that Cottrell just had in the previous over, the fans and teammate's must be wondering why Brathwaite couldn't match him! But it was 10/10 on the degree of difficulty scale.

It was in the slot outside off, he went for glory trying to clear Holder at wide long-off but got under it just a bit too much. The bat turned on connection too so wasn't timed as well as he wanted. In the air for awhile before coming down to the West Indies captain three yards inside the rope.

4152,2ndInnings$2.18 pm Australia end an over short, but a brilliant fightback nonetheless led by Smith and Coulter-Nile. West Indies paid for some inconsistent fielding though. Smith arguably should have been caught at deep fine leg on 26 but Cottrell misjudged the chance and Coulter-Nile was also grassed on a much simpler effort by Hetmyer on 61 at deep midwicket. The wides were also costly too, releasing the pressure after West Indies had Australia under the pump. Can West Indies chase this down? See what our MatchDay studio panel has to say.
4152,2ndInnings$In spite of that earlier misjudged chance by Cottrell, he made up for it later with this stunner to finally claim Smith at deep fine leg. Watch Sheldon Cottrell's sensational catch on the boundary. It came after Smith and Alex Carey initially led Australia's fightback to dig out of a major hole at 79 for 5. Watch how Smith and Carey put Australia back in the game (UK, IRE, AUS only).

This one holds its line on fourth stump going across instead of swinging in, angles across Lewis on a good to fullish length at 86 mph, Lewis prods with a diagonal bat angle and the ball clips the edge flying to Smith's right at second slip, taken at thigh height crouching into a mini-slide to cushion the take.

4152,2ndInnings$Drinks West Indies are in control but a wicket could change things very quickly. It's been a rollicking ride so far with three successful player reviews! Qasim : "This match is so beautifully poised. This has the potential to be the match of the tournament so far. A few quick wickets or a good 15-20 runs over for WI could change the game so quickly."

4152,2ndInnings$Zampa to Holder, no run, floated into the legs, goes to sweep and after a very very long appeal, given out! If Holder had the Maxwell lbw overturned you can bet he was gonna go to DRS on this and after a chat with Russell he does. He's hit fairly low on the back leg bending forward missing the sweep. Impact was barely in line with leg stump and once again this is overturned. It didn't look promising live and umpire Palliyaguruge has this overturned, missing leg stump comfortably. Both umpires are having a shocker today.

4152,2ndInnings$Starc to Russell, OUT, Russell's fiery cameo ended by Starc! And a brilliant take by Maxwell too! Russell continues backing away from leg stump for a mow over midwicket, Starc targets leg stump and Russell gets a leading edge skier over point. Maxwell runs out from the circle taking this over the shoulder a third of the way to the rope. Sensational grab, 8/10 on degree of difficulty but it was bog standard for Maxwell. Whatever Holder said to Russell at the start of the over to have him rein in his aggression failed to produce the desired effect from the captain. Totally unnecessary from Russell at this stage.

4152,2ndInnings$Coulter-Nile to Holder, no run, short ball, goes to pull and is beaten.
4152,2ndInnings$Umm Abeeha: "Aggressive captaincy by Finch bowling his main bowlers now with 2 overs of the 5th bowler remaining. Other captains would have bowled their 5th bowler now, keeping the main bowlers for the crunch. Looking for wickets sensibly. Smart and brave." Well, except for the part where he hasn't offered a slip since Brathwaite came in and there have been quite a few edges gone begging.

4152,2ndInnings$Coulter-Nile to Holder, 1 run, short ball at full pace this time sits up on the off stump line, laces a ferocious pull on one bounce to cow corner, 50 up for Holder at a run a ball. Can he finish off the chase?

4152,2ndInnings$Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, SIX runs, Brathwaite has officially joined the party! Another bouncer, wide outside off, Brathwaite has to drag this a long way to get it over midwicket, but that's pure muscle on the pull and it sails away.

4152,2ndInnings$Cummins to Brathwaite, 1 run, nearly a runout! At both ends! Fullish length ball driven to mid-on. Warner fields and fires at the non-striker's end, would've been out by 3 yards if it hit but was wide by 2 yards. Cummins fields the miss mid-pitch and throws to Carey, nearly nabs Holder but he's just in by 4 inches. Replay shows Carey knocked the bails off without the ball in his hands.

4152,2ndInnings$Starc to Brathwaite, OUT, slower ball brings a wicket! It was an attempted yorker with plenty of pace off it, met by Brathwaite at shin height as a low full toss, but completely miscues it off the toe of the bat high over mid-on. Finch backpedals 10 yards back and to the left before taking it with ease. The tension rises a few notches. Can Holder shepherd the tail across the line?

4152,2ndInnings$Starc to Holder, OUT, Starc is winning this for Australia! The pressure looked like it was getting to Holder after missing out on a meaty full toss the previous ball. Starc follows it up with a bouncer on the leg stump line, he goes to pull but is late and it thuds off the gloves. The ball balloons to Zampa at short fine leg, he only needs to take three steps forward from the ring to claim this at chest height.
