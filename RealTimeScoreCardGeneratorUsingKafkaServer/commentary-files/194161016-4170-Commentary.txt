4170,1stInnings$Cottrell to Guptill, OUT, starts off with a wonderful yorker first up and goes up in loud appeal. Shake of the head by the umpire and Jason Holder has gone up for a review. Ultra-Edge confirms no bat.Pitches on middle, swings in late, and it's taking out leg stump. What a start for West Indies! Wicket off the first ball, and it's Martin Guptill, the man who hit 237 against them in the 2015 World Cup quarterfinal

4170,1stInnings$Cottrell to Williamson, 4 runs, full toss second ball outside off, stroked easily through cover, and a bit of comical fielding by Brathwaite. He was running after the ball and dived too early with the ball still away from him! Ends up sprawled on the ground with the ball running away from him, until Shai Hope scrambles and picks it up. To no avail - they have run four!
4170,1stInnings$Kane Williamson in, second ball of the match. Monga from Old Trafford: "DRS can't suppress the Cottrell salute. He waited out of the huddle as they watched the replay, and made sure he was in position to salute."

4170,1stInnings$Cottrell to Taylor, 3 runs, too full on the pads, and tucked away nicely by Taylor through midwicket. Big chase put in and they get three. What a first over.
4170,1stInnings$Uh-oh, the game is six balls old, we've had an all-run four, both openers out for first-ballers, and a Kane W cover drive. Now Evin Lewis is limping off. Not sure what's wrong with him.
4170,1stInnings$Priyank: "Well the only concern I am having at the moment is if Windies batsmen are going to face Boult with ball swinging under lights. The decision may just backfire but then they were not able to defend 321" - true enough. Might not have that many to chase given this start!

4170,1stInnings$Gayle is back on the field.
4170,1stInnings$Another NZ fan: "Don't know what to wish for - Latham to bat decently and get a bit of form and confidence back, or him to get out so we see the big-hitting allrounders. For Latham to bat fast himself would be best of all!" - see you do know what to wish for!

4170,1stInnings$Ali: "WI started their campaign by bowling out Pakistan a tad above 100. Later, they were in similar position when they dismmised half of Australian line up under 100. But lately, they've been stagnant, especially after first powerplay, and have struggled to take wickets. Remember how easily Bangladesh chased a big target against them earlier this week?"

4170,1stInnings$Cottrell to Latham, OUT, top edge gobbled by Cottrell. Out comes the march and salute. Not short enough to pull, but Latham is under pressure to go big and swipes across the line. Gets a top edge that loops straight back to the bowler. Third wicket for Cottrell

4170,1stInnings$Cottrell to Williamson, no run, through him and West Indies are considering a review for caught behind. No wait, they are not. The umpires are going upstairs I think. Yes they are. Soft signal is out. Lovely ball, on leg stump and cutting in. Williamson was moving away, giving himself room, gets cramped and the ball goes between his bat and body, takes a feather. Hope dives to his left to take the ball. But replays show he grounded it while diving. Kane survives

4170,2ndInnings$Boult to Hope, OUT, dragged it on! Boult pushes one across, very wide outside off. Hope throws his hands at it for the drive. It's not a menacing ball - going straight across - but it's a tad far. And there's no real way he can be close to it for the drive. Inside edge and into the stumps

4170,2ndInnings$0
4170,2ndInnings$Santner to Brathwaite, no run, Cottrell sends him back and it is the right call. Brathwaite was ready to run after defending this into the off side. But it was a quicker one and it pinged quickly towards point. It was trouble if they'd gone

4170,2ndInnings$It's time for Boult now. Slightly jittery nerves time for New Zealand yet? They ran into Cottrell when he was bowling, surely they won't find him a stumbling block when he's batting?

4170,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Cottrell, OUT, through him! Is that it? Lockie using that pace of his to fire one in full, angling in off the pitch, beating the inside edge and smashing the stumps

4170,2ndInnings$Boult to Brathwaite, 2 runs, pulled to deep square's left and Oshane has actually though about staying in the crease at the other end! All good in the end as the fielder has to recover and there's time to complete the second

4170,2ndInnings$1
4170,2ndInnings$Boult to Brathwaite, 1 run, lovely stop from Williamson! Gets big and flaps out his left hand as he slides to stop this on the half-volley mid-off. Brathwaite cleared the front leg and sliced this to his left. The stop means Oshane is on strike.

4170,2ndInnings$0
4170,2ndInnings$Boult to Thomas, no run, that's the end of Boult. Oshane has done it. He's played three balls from the best bowler on the day. What a spell from Boult, but he couldn't get this last inswinger past Oshane's push to mid-on

4170,2ndInnings$Sudarshan: "Brathwaite made Cottrell face 26 out of the 35 balls in the partnership. That's a masterclass on how not to play with a #10. " --- If a No. 10 is capable of seeing out the majority of a partnership, does your argument hold?

4170,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Brathwaite, SIX runs, smokes it over the long-off boundary! Fast and overpitched just outside off. Makes room and creams it from underneath. Mid-off was in, there was hardly any risk. Lovely batting

4170,2ndInnings$6
4170,2ndInnings$Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, clears long-on! Flat-bats it and hardly gets height on this, but he's got plenty of distance. Literally swipes from above waist height
4170,2ndInnings$47.3
4170,2ndInnings$6
4170,2ndInnings$Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, and another! It is no longer a clear New Zealand advantage! Low full toss wide outside off. Reaches out and gets bat - just enough bat - to get it to land on the padding at deep backward point!
4170,2ndInnings$47.4
4170,2ndInnings$6
4170,2ndInnings$Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, it is too full! It is too far outside off! Knee high full toss with lots of width and he smokes it over wide long-off! Unreal. How does he keep finding himself in these situations, and doing this? Three in a row.
4170,2ndInnings$It's a packed off side field, it's going to full and outside off
4170,2ndInnings$Ohhh boy! Conference - four man conference. New Zealand are feeling this. Matt Henry is feeling this. He began this England tour conceding 107 in the first warm-up game. He's been here - West Indies taking him apart. It's happening again. Can he hold his nerve?
4170,2ndInnings$47.5
4170,2ndInnings$4
4170,2ndInnings$Henry to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, top edge clears the wicketkeeper! Hear in the mouth, but he fortune is all his, it seems! Bouncer cramps him at the chest. He has no control over this shot. But it's trickled through to the third man boundary. 24 off the over!
4170,2ndInnings$What now for Brathwaite?
4170,2ndInnings$47.6
4170,2ndInnings$1

4170,2ndInnings$48.2
4170,2ndInnings$0
4170,2ndInnings$Neesham to Brathwaite, no run, beaten! Whew. Short and wide outside off. Backs away and has a swipe but it some distance away from connection

4170,2ndInnings$Neesham to Brathwaite, no run, beaten again. Short and wide outside off. Once again he's gone for the pull. Misses again

4170,2ndInnings$2
4170,2ndInnings$Neesham to Brathwaite, 2 runs, pulls out to deep midwicket and comes back for the second! What. An. Innings. He doesn't get to do a lot very often, down at No. 8. But every time he finds himself in this situation, he shines through. A maiden ODI hundred. An unlikely win in sight. Takes his helmet off, blows a kiss. Back to it.
4170,2ndInnings$Point, cover comes in, extra cover, mid-off in

4170,2ndInnings$W
4170,2ndInnings$Neesham to Brathwaite, OUT, has he done it? No! Boult plucks it at long-on! Two drops for Boult since the last game, but he's held on when it's mattered! They're checking for no-ball...it's well behind the line. This is heartbreak for Brathwaite. So close. Short ball at middle, he pulled it, but slightly from under again. Ended up slicing it, with no room. It was to Boult's right. He leaped, he held on, he balanced on his right foot. That is solid work under pressure. Both batsmen on their knees, and then Brathwaite gets up with a smile. He did his all, and then some. But it was always unlikely. And you feel like he knows that. Smiles from his opponents as they offer their commiserations. It's all shakes. It could have so easily been the other way round...
