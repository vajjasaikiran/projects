4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, back of a length on the pads, tucked to the leg side as Gayle accepts the sighter
4158,1stInnings$0.2
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, thumps the pads this time, jagging from a leg-stump line, cramping Gayle for room
4158,1stInnings$0.3
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, that is a beauty! Bangs out the perfect line and length, perfect seam position, and zings past the edge as Gayle props forward!
4158,1stInnings$0.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, driven with intent, a pleasing report of willow, but a fast-travelling ball is half-stopped at mid-off. Gayle isn't interested in the single
4158,1stInnings$0.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, another snorter! And it's swing that beats Gayle this time, wobbling past the edge from an off-stump line. Gayle doesn't chase it, to his credit
4158,1stInnings$0.6
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, no run, a maiden to open proceedings, as Gayle raises his bat out of harm's way. Tidy work
4158,1stInnings$1.1
4158,1stInnings$1w
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Lewis, 1 wide, back of a length, down the leg side, a bit of a loosener as Lewis swings into a pull but can't connect
4158,1stInnings$    Chris Gayle0 (6b)
4158,1stInnings$    Evin Lewis0 (0b)
4158,1stInnings$    Chris Woakes1-1-0-0
4158,1stInnings$Ramble: "Sometimes one forgets that Gayle has two test triple hundreds. He truly is, even at this late stage, a force of nature with the willow in hand. Suspect the "Antelope of Armageddon" (Archer's challenge to Rabada) will have a bit too much gas for him, though." We may soon find out, Archer has the ball, though Lewis will be in his sights for now
4158,1stInnings$1.1
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Lewis, no run, zippy pace! Better line, back of a length, and leaping past the edge on a fourth-stump line as Lewis drops his hands
4158,1stInnings$1.2
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Lewis, no run, solidly forward on middle and off. Archer finds a fuller line and length this time
4158,1stInnings$1.3
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Lewis, 1 run, the first run off the bat, uneasily fenced to the leg side as Lewis rises with a rib-targeting delivery and deflects it into space
4158,1stInnings$1.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, through to the keeper, late swing as Gayle leaves alone
4158,1stInnings$1.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, strewth! That had some heat! Gayle flinches inside the line as Archer bangs one in and it really takes off through to the keeper
4158,1stInnings$1.6
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, outside off on a tighter, fuller length. No stroke offered. This has been a very impressive start from England, but West Indies are playing it cool. They can make hay when they are settled
4158,1stInnings$2.1
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Lewis, 1 run, crunched with intent and a high followthrough into the covers, a touch of width but can't cash in

4158,1stInnings$2.2
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, 1 run, stabbed to mid-off, and Gayle lumbers into a quick single... the fielder was hanging back, tempting him to go for it, and he just about made it in good time
4158,1stInnings$2.3
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Lewis, no run, through to the keeper once again. 137kph on that occasion from Woakes, or 85mph if you can't do the maths
4158,1stInnings$2.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Lewis, no run, ploughing through on a tight line with a hint of movement away from the left-hander. Left alone again
4158,1stInnings$2.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Lewis, no run, a cramped drive into the covers, striking it on the up but straight to the fielder
4158,1stInnings$2.6
4158,1stInnings$W
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Lewis, OUT, yorker! That is tremendous bowling from Woakes, just slipping in the fuller ball, rattling through Lewis's defences as his weight toppled forward in anticipation of another drive. No issue with the zing bails on that occasion, England are up and running!
4158,1stInnings$E Lewis b Woakes 2 (14m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00

4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, beaten again, outside off, as Archer clocks 91mph on that occasion. Tight line to off stump

4158,1stInnings$Shai Hope arrives. The anchorman of the West Indies innings. They may need him in these conditions
4158,1stInnings$3.2
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, another leave-alone as Archer ploughs a pacy furrow outside Gayle's off stump with seam and bounce to the fore
4158,1stInnings$3.3
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, on the stumps this time, 90mph once more. Gayle blocks with a full face of the bat, slightly leg-sided in his stance
4158,1stInnings$3.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, another fizzing bouncer! Was fractionally leg-sided but crucially, straight at Gayle's lid! Signalled as the one for the over as the batsman flinches inside the line. 91mph on that occasion
4158,1stInnings$3.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, no run, outside off, more serious heat outside off
4158,1stInnings$3.6
4158,1stInnings$4
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs, Gayle flings the bat this time, and so nearly chops on! Fractionally shorter, so out came the pull, but he was so cramped in the shot, an under-edge zips over the bails, and away to the unguarded fine leg!
4158,1stInnings$4.1
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, left alone calmly to accept the first-ball sighter

4158,1stInnings$Rumplestiltskin: "As a guitar-dabbler I have enjoyed the idea of having a lone guitarist going through a "history of riffs" at the fall of a wicket. Very different. The Gray-Nicholls electric guitar is very well made as well.

4158,1stInnings$4.2
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, solidly forward, bat on ball to midwicket
4158,1stInnings$4.3
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, in the channel outside off, another leave-alone as this one seams towards the cordon
4158,1stInnings$4.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, reaching for the drive, not quite there. Scuffed off the toe, back to the bowler
4158,1stInnings$4.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, tight line once more, angling in towards the off stump as Hope shoulders arms.
4158,1stInnings$4.6
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, this is superb, constraining new-ball bowling. Test-match lines and lengths, and demanding Test-match concentration as Hope leaves again
4158,1stInnings$Milind Donepudi: "WI batting line up is like dominos, if one fall rest will follow. not too many occasions someone in middle defended the match. " Hmm ... solidly built dominoes, with a tendency to come up in a rash of sixes
4158,1stInnings$5.1
4158,1stInnings$4
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs, stand and deliver! Gayle has had enough sighters, this one is a full length, so the flat-footed Gayle woofs a slog through the line, and Archer has to skip his toes out of harm's way as the missile sails through long-on!

4158,1stInnings$4
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs, bang! There goes another! To hell with all of this, says Gayle, as he mows a back-of-a-length delivery through deep midwicket!
4158,1stInnings$5.3
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, 1 run, Archer responds with a leg-stump lifter, a good option when those levers starts swinging. Cramped for room and jabbed down into the leg side
4158,1stInnings$5.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, no run, sizzling delivery! Tight line, back of a length, a hint of nibble off the deck as Hope plays the off-stump line and is grateful to get away with no nick to the keeper
4158,1stInnings$5.5
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, 1 run, soft hands this time, down into the cordon. Well played
4158,1stInnings$5.6
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, 1 run, fierce! An 89mph bouncer, into the armpit, as Gayle is tucked up on that leg-stump line once more and is forced to take late evasive action. Finds the single nevertheless
4158,1stInnings$6.1
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, 1 run, a sliced hack down to third man ... but Wood can't gather with a desperate stretch! He made such good ground, and seemed to have it for a split-second, but his tangle of limbs allowed the ball to squeeze out. He was perhaps late to sight that shot...

4158,1stInnings$6.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, lovely strike, excellent stop! A full, firm face of the bat, straight back down the pitch, but Woakes leaps to his right to pounce on the ball
4158,1stInnings$6.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, back of a length on a wider line, no temptation to have a hack there
4158,1stInnings$6.6
4158,1stInnings$1w
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, 1 wide, fired down the leg side as Hope can't connect with his clip off the toes
4158,1stInnings$Hamza Shah: "Is it only me who thinks Hope some shots looks like babar specially to the 3rd man." Hell yes ... a seriously classy player
4158,1stInnings$6.6
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, no run, tight wicket-to-wicket line, 83mph this time, so Woakes is clicking along nicely. Solid defence
4158,1stInnings$7.1
4158,1stInnings$4
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs, slapped with vigour through the leg side! Gayle is flexing his muscles now ... climbing into anything back of a length, and finds the gap

4158,1stInnings$7.2
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, 1 run, slashed hard over point! Doesn't connect properly, but the intent is plain. Plugs in no-man's land as they turn for the second with the cover ring giving chase ... talking of which, Jason Roy has pulled up lame!
4158,1stInnings$7.3
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, no run, short and sharp, Hope flings his gloves at the ball in self-defence
4158,1stInnings$That is a big concern for England - Roy leaves the field, he clearly stopped abruptly while chasing, an indication of a hamstring problem. We will keep you posted...
4158,1stInnings$7.4
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, no run, chipped in the air for a moment, but safely to mid-on
4158,1stInnings$7.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, no run, short again, sharp again. Defended
4158,1stInnings$Roy, of course, had a disrupted start to the season after sustaining a hamstring injury with Surrey... James Vince is on the field for now

4158,1stInnings$8.2
4158,1stInnings$4
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, FOUR runs, tonk! Have some of that, just a fraction of room to unleash the levers, and Woakes is panned over long-on!
4158,1stInnings$8.3
4158,1stInnings$6
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, SIX runs, smoked into the stands! Oh boy, this is getting tasty now! A pre-meditated march down the track, anticipating the fuller length, and crunched over the bowler's head!
4158,1stInnings$8.4
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Gayle, 1 run, flicked off the pads to square leg
4158,1stInnings$8.5
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Woakes to Hope, 1 run, squared up and gully would have swallowed that! Instead it flies safe to third man. Hope is having a torrid time, but so long as he loiters while Gayle struts his stuff...
4158,1stInnings$Harry: "Simple equation for Gayle, face 120 balls and play 50 balls . 30 x 4 and 20 x 6. Done."
4158,1stInnings$8.6

4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, 1 run, slower ball, Hope waits well, flicks his wrists and accepts the single to third man
4158,1stInnings$9.4
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Gayle, 1 run, on the toes, tucked to midwicket, and Gayle takes the quick single as Archer waves his arms in mild frustration, I think he thought the fielder could have been onto that quicker
4158,1stInnings$Vinod Rajpal: "That was the 10th Six that Chris Gayle has hit Chris Woakes in 2019 !!" Ouch
4158,1stInnings$9.5
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, no run, a flick off the toes, raps the pad, looking for another single but not this time
4158,1stInnings$Navin: "Would i be a loner for saying that this Archer guy has been over hyped/rated??" Yes. Next
4158,1stInnings$9.6
4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Archer to Hope, 1 run, furious pace! A 92mph lifter, not even a bouncer, but Hope knew nothing of it as it leapt off the cross-seam, and pounded his gloves while he was turning turtle! It's lively out there
4158,1stInnings$10.1
4158,1stInnings$0
4158,1stInnings$Plunkett to Hope, no run, a big wind-up, attempted slap from outside off, but can't time the stroke

4158,1stInnings$1
4158,1stInnings$Plunkett to Hope, 1 run, fenced through third man once more

Would he have played the fatal shot if he hadn't had a helmet. I would agree that poor technique is also a factor." --- Not sure if the Phil Hughes incident has affected batsmen since.

4158,2ndInnings$Holder to Stokes, (no ball) FOUR runs, short, and he forces this off the front foot, past mid off. Pretty amazing shot, when you consider where he placed this one!

4158,2ndInnings$sam: "Watching WI play these days is a punishment. I feel bad for the people who spent the money to watch them get spanked. Sad state of affair for WI and Pakistan. " --- They haven't been good today, but they certainly sparkled early on in this World Cup. Would hope they can get that mojo going again

4158,2ndInnings$Holder to Stokes, FOUR runs, fuller ball, and he has whipped this through midwicket to seal the win. Root and Stokes give each other a hug, as they should. This has been an overall professional performance from the hosts, and that has certainly lifted the gloom from all the washouts over the last week or so at this World Cup!
