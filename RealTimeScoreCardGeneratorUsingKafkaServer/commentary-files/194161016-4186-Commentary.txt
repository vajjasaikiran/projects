4186,1stInnings$10am Navin: Just wanted to pour in my opinion, In this edition BD seems a better side than Pak. If at all one team deserved to go to SF among these two, its definitely BD. But my heart goes out for Pak to win this game and by some "miracle" get into Semis, which is no stranger to them :) "
4186,1stInnings$Pranay: "Is it fair to say that most of the teams who lost out on a place in the SF were due to their own undoing on the field with dropped catches? WI dropped a bucketful, and so did AFG and the rest. Imagine if Tamim had not dropped Rohit."
4186,1stInnings$Shakib Al Hasan: All the games are important. Yes, we are out of the World Cup but it's an international game and we want to end on a high note. We played well consistently. We needed a bit of luck. Sometimes fielding let us down. Otherwise, I thought we played really well. Enjoying my contribution with both ball and bat - want to do it more often. Hope to continue in today's match as well. It is important for me to bat long up the order. Special to play at Lord's - the Home of Cricket. None of us have played an ODI at this ground, so will be exciting.
4186,1stInnings$Vikram: "Let's shift focus to tomorrow's league games. Huge implications on whether Australia or India play NZ. I think both teams would prefer NZ over England given the current form." --- Nooo, not yet please! We need eight-nine hours of talking points if Bangladesh bat first
4186,1stInnings$Asad Tirmizi : "This is the first time a toss is going to determine whether I watch the match or not!"
4186,1stInnings$9.52am Ten minutes to the all-important toss. Perfect time to watch our MATCH DAY show
4186,1stInnings$Sufyan: Unfortunately, a round robin format warrants that. Similar parallels to football clubs where you can win the league without beating anyone in the top4."
4186,1stInnings$10.15am Shuwair Sardar : "Few world records are in danger today: - AB's fastest century - Morgan's 17 sixes - Rohit's 264 - England's highest ODI total - Zimbabwe's lowest ODI total - Vaas' best ever bowling figure - AB's fastest ODI fifty Get ready for the Surprise." -- Oh, that reminds me.

4186,1stInnings$TR: "
4186,1stInnings$Umar Farzooq It's not fair Sri Lanka also miss that opportunity after their success against Afghan and Abandoned Bang match as well. Meanwhile, NZ had a chance to beat India in their game with the form they had at that time. So it's luck bro do not worry... If miracles happen Pak can go to top 4. and Grab the trophy. "
4186,1stInnings$Farrukh: "I am one of​ the voters who have voted that Pakistan will lose the game tonight. Simple, Pakistan is focused on winning the game with huge margin whereas Bangladesh is focused on winning this game and everyone seems to forget how good of a team they are at the moment. However, I​ do think the ​chance of my comment getting published is still less than Pakistan qualifying for the semis."
4186,1stInnings$Ziad Karim: "Yes, Shakib
4186,1stInnings$Sreshth, Pakistan should Score 15 Runs in first over and choose Autoplay for next 49 overs to score in access of 500, like we do in Video Games."

4186,1stInnings$jalal Anis: "I hear all of you guys. Couldn't resist making a comment of my own. I think the main winner in this WC is the "Toss". None of those top teams dared to take bowling after winning the toss. I wonder what would happen, had the toss won by the other teams, for example BD won the toss against India, Australia & England............."

Very poor review. Seemed to be more that he did it because he was four away from a century more than because he thought it would be overturned.

4186,2ndInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Mahmudullah, OUT, five-for with a yorker! Reverse swing at 142 kph sears into middle and leg stump beating Mahmudullah's vain stab.

4186,2ndInnings$Shadab Khan to Mashrafe Mortaza, OUT, clever by Shadab! Mashrafe had gotten into the habit of charging and this time telegraphed it too early. Shadab responded by dragging this back shorter and wider well outside off. Mashrafe not remotely close to the pitch trying to cut it as the ball comes to Sarfaraz just inside the wide guidelines outside off and he shuffles back to the stumps to take the bails off with Mashrafe's back foot a half meter short of getting back in.

Majority of the people in the ground and at home had to know it was coming. Mustafizur had to know it was coming. But this is just too good tailing into leg stump and Mustafizur is helpless trying to stab it out while backing away. What a show put on by the teenager!
