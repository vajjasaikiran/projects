4182,1stInnings$10.28am Here we go then. What lovely floodlight towers Headingley has. Kusal Perera and Dimuth Karunaratne are out in the middle, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar has the new ball, with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the slips. Over the wicket to start.

4182,1stInnings$10.23am Many thanks to Andrew Miller, who'd forgotten to fill his name in the "commentator" field, and hello, everyone. I quite like the look of India's team today, with a decent amount of batting depth. I'd go with something like this in the semi-finals, especially if they play England.

4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to Karunaratne, OUT, gone, is it? Dhoni's convinced, and Karunaratne begins walking. Width on this occasion, but it isn't short enough to cut, and he plays it with an angled bat rather than a horizontal bat, and only manages a top edge

Scoops it high in the air, somewhere between mid-on and mid-off, more towards the latter. Kuldeep, going to his right, drops the catch, and nearly collides with Pandya coming in the other direction

4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to Fernando, no run, big appeal, given! That big Bumrah angle, and Avishka has tried to drive down the ground without getting a stride forward. He's reviewed it, and the thing to look out for, I think, is whether it might have missed off stump. The ball went past the inside edge and hit the back thigh pad, so height may also be an issue. It's going over the top of leg stump, ball-tracking says. No footwork from Avishka, just looked to stand there and punch through the line, down the ground
4182,1stInnings$5.5
4182,1stInnings$4
4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to Fernando, FOUR runs, full on off stump, driven firmly down the ground, and it runs away for four despite Bumrah getting the fingertips of his right hand to it in his follow-through. First runs off Bumrah

4182,1stInnings$Kumar to Fernando, 2 runs, full outside off, and Avishka goes for the big hit over mid-on. A good idea with the field restrictions, but he doesn't really middle it. Hangs in the air for quite a while, and it comfortably clears the fielder running back, but it plops down in the outfield and just stops there

4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to MDKJ Perera, OUT, is that an edge? There was a sound, and both Sri Lankan openers have walked. Bumrah's been getting the ball to straighten against his angle all through this spell, and it happens again. Slants across the left-hander, straightens back just a touch, and Kusal, looking to punch to mid-on, gets an inside edge on it that Dhoni does well to catch, falling low to his right. On TV, Kumar Sangakkara notes that Kusal's bat was coming down from gully, and slicing across the line as a result

4182,1stInnings$Jadeja to Mendis, OUT, Gone! Impatience gets the better of Mendis, and Jadeja finds turn in his first over. A little slower than usual, and he jumps out of his crease, but he gets nowhere near the pitch of the ball. Flails desperately at it, looking to hit over mid-off, maybe, and the ball spins past his outside edge. Dhoni does the rest

4182,1stInnings$Pandya to Fernando, OUT, gone, and Hardik Pandya's slower-ball bouncer continues to take wickets. It's angling into the batsman, cramping him for room, and gets up to shoulder height. Looks to lean away and ramp it towards third man, but it keeps following him, and when the edge is taken, it's very close to the shoulder of the bat. The ball dies on its way through to Dhoni, who takes another very good catch, tumbling to his left and taking it inches off the ground

Maybe India wants jadeja in place of kuldeep to go with an extra batsman against England looking at their deep batting line up" I'd back Jadeja as the better option for England. He has a long history against them too, which helps.

4182,1stInnings$32.5
4182,1stInnings$1

4182,1stInnings$32.6

4182,1stInnings$Jadeja to Mathews, 2 runs, dropped. This has been a horrible day for Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Chances his arm, goes against the turn for the big shot down the ground. Wants to get it further to the long-on fielder's right, but the turn makes him hit straighter than intended. Bhuvneshwar sprints right, slides, gets both hands to it, and drops it

4182,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Thirimanne, OUT, down the track, and Thirimanne goes against the run of play. Kuldeep's slowness and dip does him in. Wants to make room and hit over extra-cover, but the ball dips shorter than he wants, and turns away. Ends up slicing it instead for a simple catch to Jadeja taking a couple of backward steps at backward point

4182,1stInnings$38.3
4182,1stInnings$0
4182,1stInnings$Jadeja to Mathews, no run, appeal for a stumping - did Mathews lift his foot? This is that most difficult Jadeja ball to face, the flat, quick one that spins sharply. Gets forward to defend but the ball pitches shorter than expected, making him reach for it, and rips past his outside edge. Dhoni, as always, is electric with the glovework. Where was Mathews' foot? Is it on the line, or is some part of it grounded behind it? There appears to be just a bit of bat grounded behind the crease, and the third umpire flashes the not-out sign on the big screen
4182,1stInnings$38.4
4182,1stInnings$6
4182,1stInnings$Jadeja to Mathews, SIX runs, wow. That wasn't the cleanest of strikes. Flat one angling into the stumps, and he clears his front leg for the swipe over long-on. Hits the outside half of the bat, close to the leading edge, but it still carries all the way

4182,1stInnings$1
4182,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to de Silva, 1 run, flatter, rips in sharply from outside off. DDS wants to stay leg-side of the ball but the turn cramps him, and he turns his wrists to play it to long-on

4182,1stInnings$4
4182,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Mathews, FOUR runs, another reverse-sweep. Again those two fielders behind square on the off side are in the circle - and they have to be, given the middle-overs field restrictions - and he uses his hands brilliantly to whip it over backward point

4182,1stInnings$4
4182,1stInnings$Pandya to Mathews, FOUR runs, shot! That's short on off stump, only gets up to chest height, and Mathews knows square leg is in the circle. Goes for placement rather than power on this checked pull, just beats the fielder to his right
4182,1stInnings$Pandya continues from round the wicket.
4182,1stInnings$Ganesh : "India have been brilliant in this tournament and their loss to England was mainly because of their error in strategy. On such a small ground we went with two spinners contrary to England who played with five fast bowlers. Kuldeep and Chahal went for 170 odd runs in 20 overs. Not only they were expensive also they released the pressure created by the fast bowlers. Also toss is becoming crucial and has a huge impact on the results. Bat first and take advantage of the slow surface."

4182,1stInnings$0
4182,1stInnings$Pandya to de Silva, no run, another slower offcutter, dug into the pitch on a length outside off. Leans back to try and dab it past short third man, but there's too little pace on it, and the bounce is too loopy for him to connect

4182,1stInnings$46.5
4182,1stInnings$1
4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to de Silva, 1 run, and he's ready for the yorker now. Opens up his stance. Keeps his bat very very low.

4182,1stInnings$Kumar to de Silva, 1 run, shapes to pull the short ball angled into him, but it's a slower one as well, demanding that he hold his shape that extra second longer. Does so just about well enough to get a single to long leg

4182,1stInnings$Bumrah to Mathews, OUT, gone. Not quite in the blockhole, on off stump, and Mathews actually times that really well, making a bit of room and punch-driving, but it's in the air at catchable height, and straight to extra-cover. A few meters either side of him, and that could have been a boundary. End of a wonderful knock, walks off acknowledging a big ovation. Is this the last we'll see of Mathews with the bat in a World Cup match?

4182,2ndInnings$Thanks, Andrew. Your phrasing of "middle overs" reminds me of the old days - which most of you kids tuning in won't remember - of 15-over field restrictions. Can Sri Lanka summon up the spirit of the 90s and summon up a wicket now, with some choking spin bowling backed up by incredibly vigilant fielders at short extra-cover/short midwicket? For now it's Thisara Perera's rumbling seam.
