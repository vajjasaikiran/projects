4147,2ndInnings$Aiden Markram to partner Quinton de Kock tonight. Remember, there's no Hashim Amla for this game. The Bangladeshis run out onto the field. History will be made either way tonight. If South Africa give this chase a good crack, the World Cup would've finally arrived. It's going to be Mustafizur Rahman with the new ball. Let's go.

4147,2ndInnings$4
4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Markram, FOUR runs, gorgeous shot! He seems adept at pulling these off. The ball is climbing on him. It almost seems like it gathers pace off the pitch. But who cares about all that. Markram gets his body beside it, gets up on his toes so he's on top of the bounce and clatters it between point and cover.

4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to de Kock, no run, appeal for lbw but de Kock may have been saved by an inside edge. Looks to work this full delivery on the stumps through midwicket, better off playing straight. Replays confirm the angle was taking the ball down leg too, even if there wasn't an inside-edge
4147,2ndInnings$6.5
4147,2ndInnings$1
4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to de Kock, 1 run, hits this straight to mid-off, off the thick inside edge. Excellent control from Mustafizur. Top, top bowling. Pressure building.

4147,2ndInnings$Mehidy Hasan Miraz to de Kock, OUT, dropped but Mushfiqur makes amends But guess what? De Kock has been run out. Bangladeshi fans go from agony to ecstasy in a matter of two milliseconds. De Kock looks to cut, but gets a thin edge that is put down. Clearly nervous, he takes off for a run but is left high and dry as Markram doesn't move. Mushfiqur has the presence of mind to run quickly to his right, pick up the ball and hit the stumps at the striker's end to catch him well short. Brain fade from de Kock.

4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Duminy, no run, Mustafizur has turned this game bigtime, or has he? Given out and JP Duminy reviews. Cuts back in from outside off on a length, JP is hurried into a defensive stroke which he tries to execute from the crease, but it's the fizz (no pun intended) that does him in. Hit high on the pad but mind you he was rooted to the crease and the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Clear gap between bat and pad, only thing to see was if it would've hit the stumps. Ball tracking says no so the original decision has been reversed. Huge relief for South Africa

4147,2ndInnings$Ram_Modies hits the nail on its head: "This will come down to south africa's basic errors in the field - in the last 4 overs they had fielders about 10 metres in trying to save the extra run and giving some 30 runs in excess of what they ended up conceding. Just arrogant cricket over sensible damage control processes. "
4147,2ndInnings$Imran Tahir has to hit them out of the park at the pace he runs around after picking a wicket. Can he?

4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Imran Tahir, no run, beaten again as he looks to loft this slower delivery, superb.

4147,2ndInnings$Bas: "AB was (and still is) a brilliant cricketer, perhaps the best in his time. But he's done, so why is everyone still talking about him? I love AB, but come on my Proteas fellows, move on - he is not the "chosen one" (there's no such thing)."

4147,2ndInnings$2
4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Imran Tahir, 2 runs, is this the game? No. Sliced in the air, was up for a long time but long-off couldn't quite get underneath that despite a slide. Two more to the total.

4147,2ndInnings$1
4147,2ndInnings$Mohammad Saifuddin to Rabada, 1 run, thick outside edge of this full toss, goes fine to short third man. Tahir started running, Rabada didn't respond but eventually made it
4147,2ndInnings$Sho(wk)at Khan: "Question Shashank - Is Fizz back to his best?" -- Looks injury free and was superb with his consistency

4147,2ndInnings$Assumed it could be it because Ngidi may not come out to bat. We'll see. Thought I saw him with the arm guard, but you never know.

4147,2ndInnings$Mohammad Saifuddin to Rabada, 1 run, sliced into the off side, cover and point thought the other would go for it. No one did in the end. Mehidy and Shakib the two men
4147,2ndInnings$Venkat : "The major reason I believe SA have let this game away from their grasp was their decision to chase at the toss. Failed in the first game with the bat and still unable to fathom that chasing big totals in a world cup is a different ball game altogether. Worst part is most players in the squad have vast experience playing in English conditions."

4147,2ndInnings$Sree: "Duminy reminds me of robin singh. Will keep your hopes alive when all seems lost, but gets out around the 47th over to end hopes. Have seen this earlier in the 90s too, seeing it again." -- Reminded of that India-Australia WC game in 1999 as you say that. His partnership with Jadeja kept India alive, raised a few hopes until they were all dashed

4147,2ndInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Rabada, SIX runs, clean swing, solid swing. All the way for six. Fetched this from outside off and deposited this over the long boundary at deep midwicket. SA need five more of those
