4154,1stInnings$0.3
4154,1stInnings$4
4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs, helped along to the fine leg boundary. Too short, line way outside leg. Easy pickings.
4154,1stInnings$Vineet Sarpal: "Taunton will always rule my heart, purely because of Ganguly s 183 vs Sri Lanka." -- So tell us peeps, where were you watching it?
4154,1stInnings$0.4
4154,1stInnings$4
4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs, just over the outstretched hands of Taylor at a wide first slip! Wafts at this delivery, nothing shot really. Thick outside edge, once it beat the cordon, it raced away to the third man boundary. Taylor had no time and stuck his left-hand out. Good try.
4154,1stInnings$0.5
4154,1stInnings$4
4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs, almighty heave and he's picked the bones out of it. Stand and deliver. Length ball slanting away and he disdainfully slaps this across the line
4154,1stInnings$0.6
4154,1stInnings$0
4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, no run, play and a miss. Much fuller this time, hint of nip away. Beaten

4154,1stInnings$surya: "Can someone tell why Asgar has fallen so out of favour that he can't get into this batting line up even with injuries? What has happened? This line up could do with a slow scoring long innings batsman anyways." -- Hard to believe how quickly he's fallen down the pecking order. Agree, they could do with his solidity.

4154,1stInnings$1
4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run, high in the air, very, very high. Colin deGrandhomme and Guptill were looking at each other, neither went full throttle and the catch goes down. The wind was taking the ball away from them, three players converging, in the end deGrandhomme went one handed as an afterthought and fluffed it

4154,1stInnings$Henry to Hazratullah Zazai, no run, big swing and a miss, Henry went full and a touch wide, looked to whack across the line. Not needed, but well, that's the way he plays.

4154,1stInnings$Ferguson to Noor Ali Zadran, no run, lifter that he almost nicks off! Got big on him, he was on the hop trying to fend, but is lucky to get away
4154,1stInnings$Sam: "I don't like that Henry has two modes: Take early wickets or get smashed to all corners at will. I think Southee offers more consistency."

4154,1stInnings$Neesham to Hazratullah Zazai, OUT, finally gets him after surviving two lives on 16 & 18! Zazai loves clearing the front leg to go over the on-side and Neesham wisely teases him dragging this line wider outside off stump, the front leg still flies out and the arms try to flay this over cover. The ball flies in the air toward the point sweeper Munro, who charges in 12 yards and takes this at chest height while crouching down. Zazai taps his helmet with the bat. Soaring like an eagle at the start, his wings have been clipped by Neesham.

Not the best ball, pitching on middle and angling onto leg stump on a fullish length, Rahmat wanted to flick this through square leg but he's out in front of it as it holds up a touch. The ball flies toward Guptill, who leans over to his left taking the catch falling over with a mini swan dive. Four-ball duck for Rahmat.

4154,1stInnings$3.56pm Start at 4.05pm . No overs lost.
4154,1stInnings$Ajay: "With regard to the Asghar fiasco- I agree that he isn't the greatest bat in the side, but his burning yet subdued passion as a leader has taken the side to new heights over the last two years, and they have gelled well under his captaincy. It was shocking to shake up the apple cart just before the start of such an important tournament, and its bad foreshadowing going forward- we've seen too many subcontinental teams torn apart by cricket boards and CEO's driven by big egos and power trips."
4154,1stInnings$Stef is quite annoyed: "So frustrated yet again by Williamson's captaincy. Guy is a great batsman, but captain not so much. Firstly you leave Henry on when he is getting smashed to all parts. Then Afghanistan lose 4/5 and you bring on deGrandhomme? What the heck? Bring back Boult and finish this off. He is so conservative!"
4154,1stInnings$3.50pm The covers are coming off, we aren't far away from a resumption.
4154,1stInnings$A small transcript of a mini-discussion between Peter, who has covered enough Afghanistan cricket, and I:
4154,1stInnings$Shashank: Do you think Asghar Afghan has been given a raw deal? 
4154,1stInnings$PDP: well, he wasn't doing anything special to merit keeping his spot as of late, but this is a classic situation where absence makes the heart grow fonder 
4154,1stInnings$Shashank: Is there anyone who is missing from the squad but deserved to make it, according to you? 
4154,1stInnings$PDP: Batting-wise, curious they've gone for Ali Khil to replace Shahzad instead of Shafiqullah Shafaq, valuing pure gloveman in Ali Khil over an attacking keeper-bat in Shafaq. Batting options otherwise are fairly slim. Usman Ghani, Javed Ahmadi haven't done much since last World Cup 
4154,1stInnings$Shashank: Ikram is a good pick, plays conventional cricket and is more an accumulator than a dasher, the kind Afghanistan need. 
4154,1stInnings$PDP: yeah, I vaguely remember him at that event. Him and Mujeeb were standouts.
4154,1stInnings$3.39pm The umbrellas are out as well. Taylor has both hands folded at slip as the wind blows across the ground. The umpires converge and they are calling for the covers. Nabi and Williamson, who have played a lot of cricket together at Sunrisers Hyderabad, have a laugh as they walk off the field. Do note, they didn't necessarily run off the field. So that's perhaps an indication that it wasn't hosing down. There's stiff breeze though, which brings with it hope that the clouds will blow away soon.

I was a bit surprised to read a comment from "Mark Lundy" who is a convicted double murderer in NZ. " -- Cheers, thanks for the clarification, obviously unaware of that.

4154,1stInnings$Neesham to Mohammad Nabi, OUT, what a poor stroke from an experienced campaigner. Nothing shot, hangs his bat out, presumably to late cut, but this one bounces a touch more than Nabi expects, gets a thin edge and Latham does the rest. Latham now has four.

4154,1stInnings$S Rajesh, our stats editor chimes in: In the first 25 overs, Afghanistan have played 98 dot balls (0 runs off the ball, including extras). That's the second-highest in the tournament so far in the first 25 overs of an innings. The highest was also by them - 102 against Australia. So while they have hit 16 fours and a six in the first 25 - which is joint third-highest in the tournament so far - they just haven't been able to rotate the strike enough

Henry went short on off stump to Alikhil, who fended at it with an angled bat leaping off his toes. It clipped the edge and flew high to Taylor at slip, he hopped in the air and reached high over his head with his right hand but could only manage to parry it away to third man. He got plenty of palm behind it, more than just the fingertips, but it didn't stick.

Attempted wide yorker outside off just pitches before Alikhil drives hard, but Alikhil's back knee dips instead of getting on top of the ball to be able to drive this into the ground. Instead he slices under it and it flutters like a peaceful dove toward Guptill at backward point, taken on his haunches at chest height with fingers pointed to the sky.

Rashid came a step forward to defend but it climbs into his helmet and ricochets down onto the stumps. Kane Williamson, his captain at Sunrisers, comes over to put his arm around Rashid and check on him as the champion leggie is shaken up.

4154,1stInnings$Ferguson to Aftab Alam, OUT, Aftab's adventurous stay ends. Identical shot to two balls earlier backing away to a short ball. That angle was going to keep producing top edges and sure enough this one is skied over the wicketkeeper towards third man. Latham tracks back to the edge of the ring calling off third man running in from the rope and takes a very sharp catch over the shoulder, 7.5/10 on degree of difficulty particularly with the ball tailing away. He's got five takes in the innings, one away from tying the ODI record.

4154,2ndInnings$Gulbadin Naib to Williamson, no run, appeal as Williamson is beaten on the drive. Gulbadin was dead sure there was a nick and went up for a review even without consulting with the wicketkeeper.

It doesn't matter if they come quick, we need more as the top teams all have opening pairs who regularly have stands beyond the 100 run mark and against good bowling. Guptill has show in the past he is a true performer. Munro has yet to do so and has had plenty of chances."

4154,2ndInnings$Another little factoid about Hamid Hassan. In 2007, he played as an overseas amateur for Norden Cricket Club in Lancashire, once taking an eight-for in a league match when he was 20 years old. Having been noticed by a Norden club member on an MCC tour fixture against Afghanistan, Hassan became their designated overseas amateur because they had already contracted former Pakistan international Asif Mujtaba as their overseas pro. For those curious, Asif Mujtaba is now a USA national team selector having migrated to Dallas, Texas. Small, small world. We might see some appearances in the crowd from the Norden brigade when Afghanistan takes on England at Old Trafford later in this tournament.

4154,2ndInnings$27.4
4154,2ndInnings$0

4154,2ndInnings$Coming back to the appeal in the previous over, Afghanistan may have just had Latham had they had a review. Came back as all three reds. I'd mentioned an inside-edge but the spike was of the bat hitting the flap of the pad at the time the ball thudded in. Gulbadin's burned review has denied them a wicket
