4143,1stInnings$0.2
4143,1stInnings$W
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Bairstow, OUT, Tahir strikes! Faf's tactical twist has brought immediate dividends, but it's Bairstow who falls first. He lunges onto the front foot to one that grips and turns just far enough to kiss the outside edge on the way through to de Kock, and Tahir's off in celebration! Head aloft, arms spread wide, and no-one can catch him. Pure joy, and England are 1 for 1!
4143,1stInnings$JM Bairstow c ((wk))de Kock b Imran Tahir 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00

4143,1stInnings$0.3
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, wrong 'un from Tahir, but Root picks it and presents bat and pad close together to keep it out
4143,1stInnings$Manne Praful Ya: "first duck of the world cup "
4143,1stInnings$0.4
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, inside edge this time, and Tahir finds more grip on another googly. But Root puts bat to ball, and keeps it out
4143,1stInnings$Davo : "Who would've thought a leg spinner bowling the first ball to open a World Cup?? I'm sure this has never happened before!" -- I think you might be right
4143,1stInnings$0.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, quicker, and flatter through the air and Root is half forward to push it back to the bowler
4143,1stInnings$0.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, and a tight end to the over as Tahir hones in on Root's off stump and a fourth googly in a row is tucked into the leg side
4143,1stInnings$Asher: "DuPlessis' Deepak Patil moment! Bairstow had not prepared for this question! Brilliant strategy. What a start to the WC "
4143,1stInnings$1.1
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, no run, there's no loosener from Ngidi as he finds immediate bite and lift outside off. But Roy does well to ride it, fending to point
4143,1stInnings$Lungi Ngidi will share the early duties. Two slips in place
4143,1stInnings$    Joe Root0 (4b)
4143,1stInnings$    Jason Roy1 (1b)
4143,1stInnings$    Imran Tahir1-0-1-1
4143,1stInnings$A brilliant first over from Tahir. How will England respond?
4143,1stInnings$1.2
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, sharp bounce once again from Ngidi, and a touch of seam movement back in to the right hander too, but it's nudged off the hip and down to fine leg for one
4143,1stInnings$A short, catching midwicket has been brought in now as South Africa look to attack
4143,1stInnings$1.3
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, Root is up on his tippy-toes to get on top of another rising delivery from Ngidi, pressing it firmly to extra cover

4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, fuller, and straighter, Root aiming his drive right at mid off
4143,1stInnings$1.5
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, laced through cover! Ngidi aimed fuller still, but this came out as a long half volley, and Root was into position with minimalist grace to put it away
4143,1stInnings$Michael: "If Tahir lands em right legspinners can be very hard to play for new top order batsmen. Could be a masterstroke from the Saffas!" -- The only question is, how many overs do they give him? He's got such an important job to do in the middle overs
4143,1stInnings$1.6
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, 1 run, that's a better length from Ngidi, and there's a hint of inside edge as Root clips a seamer down to fine leg
4143,1stInnings$Jack: "Hey Liam, isn't Faf calling time of his ODI career at the end of this WC?" -- He hasn't said anything definitive, but it's quite likely. Especially if they win it
4143,1stInnings$2.1
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, 1 run, full, straight and Root is forward to push a single wide of mid on

4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Roy, 1 run, Roy sets himself for a huge hoick down the ground, but he doesn't get all of it and the ball ricochets off Tahir's boot, off the umpire, and into space for a single
4143,1stInnings$2.3
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, 1 run, flicked straight of midwicket for one more
4143,1stInnings$2.4
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Roy, no run, too short from Tahir, but he's not punished for it as Roy's cut finds point
4143,1stInnings$2.5
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Roy, 1 run, Roy stays deep in his crease once again, nurdling a single through square leg
4143,1stInnings$2.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, swept this time, but now the shot finds short fine leg and it's another dot
4143,1stInnings$Ash kumar: "tahir finishing his over really quick. CSK effect probably!"
4143,1stInnings$3.1
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, tennis-ball bounce outside off as Roy thrusts out at it, the ball flying through the vacant gully region and down to third man
4143,1stInnings$More Ngidi. And the two slips remain in place

4143,1stInnings$3.2
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, beaten outside off by one that holds its line outside off. He's been seaming them in, but this one just kept going outside off to beat Root's edge
4143,1stInnings$3.3
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, this one does seam in a shade, and Root is back and across to defend to cover
4143,1stInnings$3.4
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, boom! Too short from Ngidi, and Root reads the length nice and early to get himself into position to pull to midwicket. It's the long boundary, but there's a big gap to aim for too
4143,1stInnings$Seth Miller: "This has to be the most unexpected start to the WC. England lose a wicket second ball, a legspinner bowls the first over and takes a wicket, and Rabada stlil hasn't come on. What's this world coming to? Well at least some things stay the same. Tahir still takes off after a wicket! :)"
4143,1stInnings$3.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, just short! Ngidi aims fuller and wider, and Root has to stretch into a drive and can't keep it down. Fortunately for him, the ball lands just short of Duminy, who has been moved into gully
4143,1stInnings$3.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, Ngidi keeps things tight on off stump to finish, and Root is content just to keep it out
4143,1stInnings$nuke infer: "what happend to David Miller?" -- nothing, he's fit. Just not picked
4143,1stInnings$4.1
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Roy, FOUR runs, too short and Roy hops back to hammer a cut well in front of square
4143,1stInnings$Tahir into his third over now from the Vauxhall End
4143,1stInnings$    Joe Root11 (16b)

4143,1stInnings$4.2
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Roy, 1 run, Tahir loops this one up a little slower, and much fuller. Roy is forward to tap it to long on for one
4143,1stInnings$Saquib: "Game moving ahead at a great pace. 4 overs in 16 minutes.. that's amazing" -- Yep, my fingers know all about it too
4143,1stInnings$4.3
4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, 2 runs, and so Root goes for the reverse sweep, picking the gap nicely. But Rassie's after it, and hauls the ball in inside the rope
4143,1stInnings$Two men behind square for the sweep
4143,1stInnings$4.4
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, FOUR runs, swept hard! An orthodox stroke from Root this time, and he's helped by some creaky fielding from Amla at short fine, who falls over the ball as it passes him but can't stop it
4143,1stInnings$4.5
4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, 2 runs, chipped in the air! But safe. It was a full toss too, and Root might have put this anywhere. Perhaps he was taken a little by surprise, and does at least manage to pop it just over a leaping Rabada at midwicket
4143,1stInnings$4.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Imran Tahir to Root, no run, speared in flat and fast to finish, and Root defends
4143,1stInnings$5.1
4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 2 runs, too straight, and he's neatly clipped off the hip and through midwicket for a brace

4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, no run, rising off a length, on or around off stump, and Roy pushes him to midwicket
4143,1stInnings$WATCH - Graeme Swann doesn't quite agree with England's XI. Do you think he's right?
4143,1stInnings$5.3
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, FOUR runs, Ngidi's lost his radar with this one, offering a gentle leg-stump length delivery that Roy helps on its way down to fine leg
4143,1stInnings$5.4
4143,1stInnings$1w
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 1 wide, the riposte from South Africa's big quick is to dig one in halfway down, but the bouncer balloons up way too high and is called wide
4143,1stInnings$mobeen: "Not a great day, first my fantasy league vice captain david miller left out and now my captain goes out first ball" -- commiserations
4143,1stInnings$5.4
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, sliced in the air through gully! Where is the fielder? Ngidi aims fuller, and wider, and Roy holds nothing back in the drive - but there's no-one there to catch it
4143,1stInnings$5.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, Ngidi finds that splice-jarring length and Root can't quite get on the front foot as he defends this one
4143,1stInnings$5.6
4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, 2 runs, Root is one the drive once again, but Markram hares after it to keep them to two
4143,1stInnings$Shilpa: "Good morning from the USA, Liam. What is the difference between a bouncer and a wide? Why are some bouncers allowed and some called wide or no ball? Thanks." -- Welcome to cricket, Shilpa. If a short ball, or bouncer, travels through at above head height, it's called a wide. Anything lower than that is legitimate
4143,1stInnings$6.1
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, FOUR runs, and he's punched down the ground! Gosh, this is a lightning quick outfield. Rabada aimed full to start, but this was nothing more than a push from Roy. Once it beat the bowler, and mid off, it was four
4143,1stInnings$"Give the ball to Rabada please Faf...." wails Franklin, and here, finally, is Rabada. He, too, has two slips in place

4143,1stInnings$6.3
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, no run, shorter still from Rabada, but this one is aimed wide of off and Roy shoulders arms
4143,1stInnings$6.4
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, no run, another steepler on a fifth stump line, and Roy is at pains to pull his hands out of harm's way as he leaves well alone
4143,1stInnings$6.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, no run, Roy sets himself to drive again, but he's not quite to it and pokes his shot uppishly towards Phehlukwayo at mid off
4143,1stInnings$Chris Geary: "Completely agree with Swann's comments. Plunkett looking a bit long in the tooth(past 12 months) whereas Curran brings a lot more fire in his belly."
4143,1stInnings$6.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, no run, indipper from Rabada, at a decent clip too - 90mph. But Roy is forward with bat and pad together to defend to point
4143,1stInnings$Dhaval : "After 4 long years and 100+ games, back to the matches which matters the most. Probably the best Batting side vs the best bowling side. Couldn't get better than this. Mouth watering stuff this!"
4143,1stInnings$7.1
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, Root is drawn into an injudicious prod outside off by a cross-seamed delivery from Ngidi that holds its line outside off, beating the bat
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi into his fourth now.
4143,1stInnings$    Jason Roy21 (19b)

4143,1stInnings$7.2
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, 1 run, neat follow-up from Ngidi, a slower ball. It cuts in off the track. Root defending to leg with a hint of inside edge
4143,1stInnings$Alan Hardy: "What's the crowd like? Is the ground full?" -- Yep, house-full by the looks of things. And quite a buzz too
4143,1stInnings$7.3
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, FOUR runs, crisp! Ngidi has found tennis-ball bounce, but Roy just stands up on this one - another cutter - and checks his drive, on the up, to collect four more
4143,1stInnings$maro: "Good moning from New Zealand, Shilpa. What's the difference between a knuckle-ball and a strike? Why are some knuckle-balls called strikes and some called balls?"
4143,1stInnings$7.4
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, Roy is up on his toes again to spank this short one towards point, where Duminy parries and takes the sting out of the shot, so it's just the one
4143,1stInnings$7.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, and now it's Root standing tall, and punching to cover. But he pings the field
4143,1stInnings$graybo: "I'm at work, so can't listen to audio commentary. Can you include a bit of background murmur from the crowd in your text to add to the atmosphere, please?" -- rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb
4143,1stInnings$7.6
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Root, no run, Ngidi offers a little width outside off, but again Root picks out the cover fielder with his forcing stroke
4143,1stInnings$Mandy: "How's the weather today??I hope no rain God's appear today..." -- So far, it's set fair! A glorious early summer's day in South London

4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Roy, 1 run, and Roy brings up England's fifty with a neat little clip into the leg side, finding just enough room for a quick single
4143,1stInnings$Aayushman: "Are the Barmy-army singing their tunes?" -- Not yet, but give them a while to get sufficiently lubricated
4143,1stInnings$8.3
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Root, no run, Rabada pulls his length back at 87mph, Root jumping to defend into the leg side
4143,1stInnings$alan chadwick: "re the England team - I'd have Curran - the best death bowler and good lower order runs - instead of Stokes - only an occasional bowler recently, completely bottles death overs and far from our best batsman."
4143,1stInnings$8.4
4143,1stInnings$4
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Root, FOUR runs, short, and pulled! Root has looked in absolutely top form on the pull today, and even though he was a little rushed by Rabada's pace he controlled the stroke and placed it just so to collect four
4143,1stInnings$8.5
4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Root, no run, Rabada adjusts his line, outside off, and Root presses firmly to cover
4143,1stInnings$8.6
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Root, 1 run, good awareness from the batsmen in the middle as Root pushes a fuller one towards Tahir at mid on and they sense the opportunity for a quick single
4143,1stInnings$moshe: "so pumped to be following my 8th wc, remember like yesterday the 92 edition in AUS and how SA were robbed against England in the semis by the rain, ever since we've just had mixture of bad luck & chokes - irony is this year is probably our weakest side and for once were no ones favorites - hoping against all odds that 2019 is our year. die hard sa fan"
4143,1stInnings$9.1
4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Pretorius to Root, 2 runs, and his line is just a little too straight to start, Root shuffling across to pick up two more through midwicket
4143,1stInnings$Here's a change - Pretorius into the attack to bowl some medium pace

4143,1stInnings$9.5
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Pretorius to Roy, 1 run, surprise bouncer from Pretorius, and Roy can't take full advantage as he pulls to fine leg for one

4143,1stInnings$10.5
4143,1stInnings$1

4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Morgan, FOUR runs, exquisite! So still at the crease, pile-driving his hands through the line of an over-pitched delivery, and clean through long-off

4143,1stInnings$0
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Morgan, no run, cunning slower ball, pops a touch as Morgan flicks into a defensive push, but falls well short of being a return catch
4143,1stInnings$Ghalib: "Hi Miller! Considering current state of the match and SA batting line up... What target will be on England's mind? Will 350 be enough?" I think (think...) England have learnt from experience that some days they can't afford to get greedy. This has been a good and wholehearted effort from SA so far ...

4143,1stInnings$6
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Morgan, SIX runs, no faffing around from Morgan! Gallivanting out of his crease, a lofted slap over wide long-off!

4143,1stInnings$6
4143,1stInnings$Ngidi to Morgan, SIX runs, drags down the bouncer, Morgan climbs into the pull! That's a sweet, sweet connection, getting right underneath the stroke and lifting it high over fine leg

4143,1stInnings$2
4143,1stInnings$Duminy to Morgan, 2 runs, and now the reverse-sweep, he's always played that stroke well. A half-stop at backward point but good intent
4143,1stInnings$27.1
4143,1stInnings$1
4143,1stInnings$Markram to Stokes, 1 run, punched with power to the cover sweeper. This pair are looking settled, as indeed the previous pair did until they got out in quick succession ...

4143,1stInnings$hardik: "Stokes is a weight in this team. Butler has to be batting ahead of Stokes based on batting quality alone. Stokes is not coming in at 7 because he isn't as explosive and needs time. Butler is now always expected to get going from the start. Why not give Butler time to settle? Plus the minor advantage of a left-right combo." Buttler is more than capable of running riot in the last 15 ... Stokes has played a key role given how the wickets have fallen

4143,1stInnings$Rabada to Stokes, 1 leg bye, full-bunger, smacked on the boot... Half-hearted appeal from Rabada but SA review, though it looked plenty leg side to me. No bat on it as Stokes whooshed across the line, but it clearly pitched outside leg, so on we go
4143,1stInnings$Srinath is studying the form intently: "This is the first time 'new' England are batting first at the Oval. They've chased in five other games since Apr 2015, won four, and the fifth time, made 365 chasing 398 v New Zealand."

4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, no run, fuller length on the toes, clipped with intent but short midwicket's hands are true. England looking sharp in the field
4143,2ndInnings$Jonny: "South Africa bowled tidily, Faf's captaincy was near-perfect and England's batsmen weren't at their best...but despite all this, England still posted 311. Yikes." Yep, that's the measure of it

4143,2ndInnings$4
4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, FOUR runs, too short this time, the slip has just been removed, and de Kock gets away with a calculated slash through third man. Buttler dived but never got close.

4143,2ndInnings$Archer to Amla, no run, bouncer into the grille! That was self-evidently not a slower ball! Amla climbed into the pull but that bit him like a cobra! Proper pace from nowhere! And out comes the physio to check him over

4143,2ndInnings$4
4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, FOUR runs, this time he gets his width! A shimmy to leg, to encourage Woakes to stray to the off, and he gets his cuttable slot-ball. Duly slotted to the fence
4143,2ndInnings$4.4

4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, no run, tighter line and length, de Kock reverts to solid blockage

4143,2ndInnings$4
4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, FOUR runs, up on the toes, fizzed through to the rope off the back foot. That's supreme batting, hanging on the leg stump, a touch outside his crease, and making Woakes think again about his restrictive line
4143,2ndInnings$4.6
4143,2ndInnings$0
4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to de Kock, no run, full and into the toes, crunched to mid-on. A good tussle

4143,2ndInnings$Woakes to Markram, no run, excellent work from Roy at backward point! Loose this time from Woakes, too much width on the back foot, but a stretch to his left stopped the runs
4143,2ndInnings$6.5

4143,2ndInnings$Archer to du Plessis, OUT, banged in short, top-edged, Moeen steadies himself, gone! That is a huge scalp, and Archer is showing his value to this team from the outset. Lured the skipper into a pull, but the ball just kept getting big on him, spiralled off his eyebrows, and Moeen at fine leg had an age to contemplate his existence before pulling it off very coolly in the end...

" Indeed ... and in answer to the question of why he doesn't bowl very much these days, well, two things. One, he is there if needs be but England have options without him. And two, if he's bowling, then England's best fielder is unavailable!

4143,2ndInnings$6.03pm Well, it is fair to say that the World Cup has begun with a bang. Not the closest contest you could ever wish to witness, but one packed with subplots, stand-out scenes and a crackling good atmosphere. Forget soggy street parties on The Mall. Cricket is always best when it's left to its own devices! From Andrew Miller, Alan Gardner, Liam Brickhill (sadly benched for technical reasons, but gagging to get back in the fray) and Thilak Rama, goodbye, and don't forget to tune back in tomorrow morning for West Indies v Pakistan at Trent Bridge!

4143,2ndInnings$6pm One of our main men has been dismissed by our wildcard pick for the day. If you're wondering what we're on about, you haven't checked out our World Cup fantasy tips blog
4143,2ndInnings$5.56pm Jofra Archer is having a chat with Sky, and admits that he was running in with a bit of extra adrenalin today. There's a different atmosphere around a World Cup match, as I think everyone at The Oval today can attest ...
4143,2ndInnings$Anshul Punetha: "Someone called it almost right after the first innings. An Archer hat trick and SA out for 200... Applause for that gentleman!" Indeed, not far wrong!
4143,2ndInnings$5.53pm Well, Ben Stokes eh? It's not gone unnoticed that he's been a bit subdued in the England team in recent times, but these are the moments that England knew he would come good for. And it's interesting too, when to think back to the aftermath of the Bristol incident and Tom Harrison's insistence on "rehabilitating him in the field..." Well that's come good...
4143,2ndInnings$5.46pm Eoin Morgan "Delighted with that performance, the maturity and smart cricket that we played shows our improvement in the last two years."
4143,2ndInnings$Stokes, "extremely impressed, he's had a day out today, with a matchwinner like that in your side ..."
4143,2ndInnings$On Archer: "The slowest pitch and he bowled fast and accurate, outstanding from a young guy at the start of his career."
4143,2ndInnings$Fielding: "Huge amount of pleasure, we won't have days like this every time out, we are looking to experiment in the field."
4143,2ndInnings$Here's Faf du Plessis: "We were outplayed in all three departments today. I thought 300 was a par score, we were just bowling cutters basically, pace off was working, but there were some real good batting performances from England. Tahir at the top was a plan, they are good players of pace bowling, and it worked today. The bowling was really good, we kept getting wickets, but when chasing we need partnerships, and losing Amla, was a momentum-breaker. He's okay now, when he came off he was a bit all over the place, we were a bit worried about him, but hopefully he's okay now.
4143,2ndInnings$"When we have Dale in our resources, we back ourselves to bowl sides out as we don't have the luxury of allrounders at 7,8 and 9."
4143,2ndInnings$Ben Stokes is Man of the Match: "I had a bit of a panic on, I was a little further in that I should have been, but I've the nickname, "The Claw", and luckily it stuck!"
4143,2ndInnings$"We were thinking early doors, it's a tricky wicket, get it up to 300-330, the slower balls were digging in a bit. Boundaries were hard to get away, but psychologically getting over 300 was a big thing. Unbelievable atmosphere, great turn-out for [my] first World Cup game."
4143,2ndInnings$5.36pm Well, that is a statement win ... but not for the reasons that might have been anticipated from England's frontrunning favourites. Their batting looked a touch cramped for style today, but it was their bowling and fielding that really reaffirmed their No.1 credentials. Jofra Archer was a handful in every spell he bowled, claiming key wickets, hitting Amla on the helmet and forcing his retirement; the spinners were tight and to the point. And then there was Stokes. With the bat, with the ball, in the field. He was everywhere!
4143,2ndInnings$South Africa ... well, they have reasons to be cheerful. Faf du Plessis marshalled his resources in the field superbly - his opening with Tahir was a masterstroke - and Ngidi and Rabada proved what a threat they are going to be in this tournaement. And though they ran out of steam with the bat, Quinton de Kock was his usual forceful self at the top of the order.
4143,2ndInnings$Supradeep: "I think its needless to say at this point but Stokes simply showed what exactly a 3 dimentional player is. Deserves the MOM."
