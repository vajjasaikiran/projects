Russell has been dismissed 8 times by left arm spinners in his short ODI career at an average score (upon dismissal) of 8.37 !!

Sanath Jayasuirya had 33 of them, Shahid Afridi 27 and Mahela Jayawardene 26. This was Gayle's 25th in ODIs.

4171,1stInnings$Stat from Shiva: Shai Hope has been the slowest of batsmen in this World Cup: among 31 batsmen to score at least 100 runs, his strike rate has been the lowest at just over 61 runs per balls - a rate that was barely acceptable in the pre-T20 era. The problem? Strike rotation, or the lack of it. Hope's dot-ball percentage at 60 is among the worst in this tournament. And it's not as if Hope is better at turning the strike over when he's settled in: until the 25th over of West Indies' innings in this match, the following was his dot percentage split over his innings across matches in the World Cup. It is the least when he's faced over 60 balls, and still at an unhealthy 47%.

4171,1stInnings$Towfiq Ahmed: "I am sensing a collapse from the windies. BD is in a good position right now. Hope is still struggling and new batsman on the pitch.

4171,1stInnings$Shaikh Abu Reza: "Mustafizur Rahman is the most over rated bowler of Bangladesh team, the management hoping against hope that he will return to his previous stint, but cost of matches ?

4171,2ndInnings$Shai Hope tells Simon Doull: "It was a bit slow, but enjoyed batting there. We've got some good power in the bowling, and we've got to capitalise on the new ball and pick some wickets. Shimron and Jason batted well to give us some impetus, especially at that stage."
4171,2ndInnings$2.20pm This match is quite interestingly poised at the half-way stage. You'd have to say West Indies have done the hard yards by posting 321 on the board. But this looks like a decent batting wicket, the ground is a small one, and West Indies could be a bowler short today, since they omitted Carlos Brathwaite to accommodate Darren Bravo. The innings ebbed and flowed, but it was really the innings of Shai Hope which gave them the glue to work around

4171,2ndInnings$Holder to Soumya Sarkar, no run, oooh, there's some carry there. Angled across him, back of a length and Soumya chases that, wants to flay it. Doesn't connect
4171,2ndInnings$Salman: "You say WI have a depleted bowling attack ... but Gayle and Russell both have averages below 35 and economy rates under 6 in ODI ... with those two as part time and other 4 front line fast bowlers I think it is still a very decent attack" - fair point. I'm just a bit skeptical about Russell lasting 5-6 overs. Here's Holder.

4171,2ndInnings$Holder to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, just short of Cottrell at third man. Soumya not in control of that. Short ball outside off and he tries to ramp it, gets it too high. Cottrell was fine so was running around, can only collect on the bounce

4171,2ndInnings$Holder to Tamim Iqbal, no run, loud shout for lbw but maybe too high. Shai Hope also indicates it would have bounced over. Lovely ball, on a length on leg and straightens, Tamim is caught in a tangle, flicks the top part of his pad and goes to the keeper

4171,2ndInnings$Holder to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR runs, up and over. Too full and Soumya comes forward to drive on the up, doesn't bother to keep it down and finds the cover fence. Not timed to perfection, but enough to get a boundary in the Powerplay
4171,2ndInnings$Jez: by my tally, of the 18 games so far, 10 have been won setting and 8 chasing. Not such a big difference, right? Not sure how many of those victories batting first were after having been put in to bat. There have been quite a few skittlings out for low scores. And today, that surely looked like Bangladesh's best chance, though I may be underestimating their batting :-) !"

Didn't have the width to ramp it up and over either, and he ended up doing something in between, only guiding it to Gayle at slip.

4171,2ndInnings$Thomas to Liton Das, FOUR runs, another edge goes for four! West Indies have not helped themselves with extras but they've also been desperately unlucky in this innings. Back of a length, Liton is in no position to pull, gets a top edge that swirls to the third man boundary.

4171,2ndInnings$Pressan Pandara: "Shakib is in amazing form but to suggest he's only become consistent now is untrue. Form and consistency are different things. You don't average almost 40 and not be fairly consistent. "

4171,2ndInnings$John Iain I think that game against Australia really messed with the Windies self belief. They had Australia absolutely on the ropes there and then blew it with some really rash shots. They're a really talented side but sorely lacking in direction and control. They could learn a lot from the very side they're playing right now"

4171,2ndInnings$Gabriel to Liton Das, SIX runs, another short ball, another six! Liton is in a hurry to end this. This was a quick bouncer too, but Liton is in Superman mode, just rocks back and hooks this over fine leg.

4171,2ndInnings$4
4171,2ndInnings$Gabriel to Shakib Al Hasan, FOUR runs, and there's the mandatory edge for four. This must be West Indies' unluckiest match but they've not helped themselves minimise that with their poor discipline in bowling and missed catch off Shakib. This one was full outside off, drew him into the drive, took the outside edge and raced to third man

4171,2ndInnings$Shahir : "Can't help but feel west indies have been a bit unimaginative as well, not that there's much room for it with the hostile, all out pace attack, but definitely this is where a bowler like Amir comes in with his smarts & game awareness and comes up with a new plan quick! " - there is room for it, but for that the pace attack has to be 'hostile'. This one has often not been.

4171,2ndInnings$Holder to Liton Das, no run, short ball that pops up towards square leg off a mistimed pull. Russell is there but he does what can only be described as a hobble-run towards the ball. I don't know how his joints are working to put one leg in front of the other, frankly.

4171,2ndInnings$Gabriel to Liton Das, FOUR runs, fittingly this match ends with a short ball that's pulled to the boundary. Moved inside the line again and pulled it well to the left of the fine leg fielder, who could be forgiven for not really exerting himself while running after it as it bounces over the ropes. Bangladesh have just demolished West Indies in stunning fashion. Highest successful chase in Bangladesh's ODI history, and highest in this World Cup.
