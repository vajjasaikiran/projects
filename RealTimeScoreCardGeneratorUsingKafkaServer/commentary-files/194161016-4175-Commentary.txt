4175,1stInnings$Roach to Sharma, OUT, good length and has it paid dividends? There was a noise as it went past the bat and West Indies have reviewed it. Pitched on a hard length and jagged back in sharply. Rohit left a gap between bat and pad, and the ball snaked through that. Did it hit bat or pad though? The third umpire says bat, and Roach has struck a huge blow. Rohit Sharma is shaking his head as he walks off, it appears he doesn't think he got an inside edge.

Hope tried to flick the ball back towards the stumps from half a foot away and missed again! Dhoni makes it back, and they even steal a bye. To complete a trifecta of misery, Hope even misses scoring a direct hit at the non-striker's end

4175,1stInnings$Holder to Kohli, OUT, Kohli's filthy with himself. He's just pulled a half-tracker to midwicket. It was short, seemed to stop a bit on the pitch. Didn't bounce as much too. Kohli got into position to pull but played it too early, had to also adjust for lack of bounce and the ball goes very tamely off the toe end. Comfortable catching height and he gobbles it up. Kohli can't believe it, but he has to walk back

4175,2ndInnings$Vatz: "The "debate" about Indian middle order is an overreaction. I think the middle order is doing fine. Jadhav got a 50 in the previous game, Dhoni in this one, and Pandya has chipped in with decent cameos as well. A hole was created at number 4 due to Dhawan's injury. India has tried Shankar so far, but they can move to DK if Shankar doesn't perform - but there's no serious crisis here I'd say. "

In earlier days, this wouldn't be the same case with Dhoni. Every match with Kohli and Dhoni, India would post 20 more runs than the desired total.

Bowled the offcutter, and Ambris didn't read it, played all around it and was struck on his pads, right in front. Opts not to review - and I think that's a good decision. Perhaps not as good a decision by Pandya to mockingly clap and tell the batsman he has to leave.

4175,2ndInnings$Natraj: "For all the no.of people questioning Dhoni's strike rate, I don't understand how not even one question Rahul's. If Dhoni is so bad at his, how come Rahul is seen as doing a perfect job. Does it all come to just batting position? Isn't match situation more important as well?" - I think Rahul definitely needs to not let the dot balls accumulate the way he has done, and his strike rate could do with a lift, true.

4175,2ndInnings$Chahal to Thomas, 1 run, tossed up, and he swings this around towards deep midwicket, but KL Rahul just cannot hold on to it! Runs in from the fence, and just seems to not have got his hands around to it as he dives forward. I think that is just the second drop by India through this World Cup!

4175,2ndInnings$Morvin Willians: "Chris Gayle has had a see-saw moment last couple of series yet he unretires which suggest he is guaranteed a place in West Indies team. If so then I can look forward to Chanderpaul's selection since he remained consistent and he never retired."

4175,2ndInnings$Mohammed Shami to Thomas, OUT, short ball, seems to have come off his shoulder. India want to review this as Shami catches it on the follow-through! It's taken the glove as he looks to pull but sees the ball get pretty big on him, and that should be all over. Michael Gough gives this out. A TV replay leads to enough evidence to overturn the original decision, in almost perfect symmetry to how the first wicket fell
