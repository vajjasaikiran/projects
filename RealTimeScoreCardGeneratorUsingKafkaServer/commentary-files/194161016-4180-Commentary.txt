4180,1stInnings$Cottrell to Karunaratne, no run, yorker, and nearly chopped it on! It got underneath the bat and was trickling on after hitting the bottom of the bat. Karunaratne had to be sharp to knock it away with the back of the bat

4180,1stInnings$Cottrell to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, another example of that. Full on leg stump, and with fine leg up, that was asking for trouble. Glanced past the man, and there was no stopping it racing to the boundary
4180,1stInnings$2.4

4180,1stInnings$Soumya: "I don't understand why this is a dead rubber? SL is not mathematically out. If the winners of the remaining matches are: SL, IND, NZ, WI, BAN, SL, AUS. Then the points table will look like: AUS 16, IND 13, NZ 13, ENG 10, SL 10, PAK 9, BAN 9, SA 5, WI 5, AFG 0. In this case, ENG and SL will be tied on 10. If England loses the match with a big margin and SL wins both the matches with a big margin, then there is still a possibility for SL to qualify. Isn't it? Or I am missing something?" No, at 10 points, like I said, number of wins is the tiebreaker. And SL have 2 points from rainouts
4180,1stInnings$6.4
4180,1stInnings$4
4180,1stInnings$Gabriel to Perera, FOUR runs, follows it up with a drag down legside. Easiest thing in the world for Perera to get a tickle on it and watch it across the fine leg boundary

4180,1stInnings$Shastri Sookdeo: "Can anyone explain why Roach was dropped after being economical in the last two games and picking up wickets against India?

4180,1stInnings$Billy Stokes misjudged initially and made it looked spectacular and English media exaggerated it. There are quite a few good catches like Cotrell, Woakes, Jadeja if you look for difficulties but not Stokes one."
4180,1stInnings$Sarah - Definitely agree those are nominees too. But what stands out in Stoke's catch is that he was not facing the direction of the ball. People thinks that is just fluke. But for me it had more technique to be just fluke. The way his elbow was bent to absorb the pressure of the ball hitting the palm is just one of it."

Ambris gives the ball a mighty chase, but rolls his left ankle while trying to field it. Was his hand touching the rope when he retrieved the ball though? The TV umpires are checking on that while the physio checks on Ambris. Nah, Ambris did a good job fielding although he's now off the field for a check-up

4180,1stInnings$Sharda Ugra: I think we may be required on the back of Dhoni's innings yesterday and the promise of my once-superman-ic idol Angleo Mathews' effort to find a new word for innings of this type. A keen eyed reader referred to the "momentum-sucking" arrival of Angelo and I propose we call these (and give full credit to JK Rowling), that these be referred to know as "DementorOfferings". At which point, Angelo has slathered one through covers. If people can suggest a better descriptors featuring Dementor, they will be most welcome. This one's for you, Minindu

4180,1stInnings$Brathwaite to Thirimanne, 1 leg bye, another slower ball. Thirimanne gets as clopse to it as these two sides are to the semis. But they do scamper a legbye

4180,1stInnings$Brathwaite to Fernando, 2 runs, full toss, tapped to long on and there's the 100! Amazing innings, and definitely not the last 100 we'll see from this 21-year old. Looks so good, and should be a leading light for SL for many, many years to come
4180,1stInnings$46.5
4180,1stInnings$4
4180,1stInnings$Brathwaite to Fernando, FOUR runs, and slices the two men in half on the leg side. Lofted through midwicket and over cow corner, and the two looking to chase it down never had a hope. Fernando is cutting loose

Struck way too low on the bat and ballooned to long-off instead of getting distance on it. 104 off 103. It's au revoir, Avishka, definitely not adieu

Andrew Fidel Fernando and I went out onto the balcony/overflow area to watch Avishka get to his century, and Riverside was a bundle of noise, music cheering and fun. Avishka's celebration was joyous - the flags were flying ghosts in Lumley Castle must have been applauding from their turrets… We return from the balcony, lifted by the atmosphere, the 'dead' game not so dead in how it was being received by the spectators, open the door to the press box and.

4180,1stInnings$sreshthx, just wondering what happened to the ESPNCricinfo fantasy-cricket-tips? There seems to be no blog update after afg v pak match. You know.... i am loosing very badly with my bluffs ;)" -- Mate, it's very much there! With my vice-captain Gabriel failing in the first innings, I desperately need a high score from my captain Shai Hope! And as we speak, the Sri Lankans join in for a huddle to begin the second innings.
4180,1stInnings$Prabath Perera: "Who is the youngest player scored 100 in a world cup?" -- Paul Stirling (Ire v Netherlands, 2011). Second is Ricky Ponting (AUS v WI, 1996) and third is Avishka today.

However, given the position we were in around the 35th over etc you would have thought that they could have scored 20-40 runs more?? Or am I just being too harsh??" -- Tad too harsh, mate!

Want to clarify that SL are eliminated since they will have one less win than ENG or IND or NZ even if they get 10 points. And 'number of wins' is the first tie-breaker between the teams that are tied on points. Net Run rate is the second tie-breaker. And here's Shai Hope for West Indies. Two slips

Still fingers crossed for NZ beating England. NZ needs to win one big match to make them a proper semi finalist."

4180,2ndInnings$0
4180,2ndInnings$Vandersay to Pooran, no run, and on that note, ends with a nice delivery. Shapes back in and driven back
4180,2ndInnings$31.1
4180,2ndInnings$0
4180,2ndInnings$Rajitha to Brathwaite, no run, kept low and Brathwaite couldn't guide this through the covers

4180,2ndInnings$Rajitha to Pooran, 2 byes, swing and a miss, but the keeper lets it sneak past him for a bye
4180,2ndInnings$31.5
4180,2ndInnings$1
4180,2ndInnings$Rajitha to Pooran, 1 run, punched back down the ground off the back foot. Singles are good but they aren't enough at this late stage
4180,2ndInnings$AnamBMDF : "In this CWC, NZ are the most fortunate earning 6 points by escaping defeats narrowly against BD, SA & WI. Otherwise, the race to Semis could be a different story for Eng/BD/Pak/SL. SL should win today and take pride for what Malinga is doing so far. Can we have a double-hatrick again by him? Waiting ...." But NZ won those games, so I can't really call holding their nerve luck

4180,2ndInnings$32.1
4180,2ndInnings$6
4180,2ndInnings$Karunaratne to Pooran, SIX runs, Nothing gentle about that shot! Greets the captain with a dismissive jab over cow corner. Nothing delivery and Pooran would not miss out on it
4180,2ndInnings$Dimuth Karunaratne to bowl some gentle medium
4180,2ndInnings$Sri: "Are we allowed to talk about tomorrow's game Ind Vs Ban ? ;)" Loopholes already? Why not talk about which of these two sides has a better chance of challenging in India at the 2023 World Cup?
4180,2ndInnings$Karttik: "So you want us to chat about a dead rubber with a predictable result! I'd rather chat about Mayank Agarwal. Is he a like for like replacement to Dhawan?" Yes, I expect exactly that of you. Save the Mayank Agarwal chat for tomorrow! You don't have to wait long :)
4180,2ndInnings$Sutte: "Not fair... the new rule came while i was typing my feedback..." You can have this published instead!
4180,2ndInnings$Dinuka K: "Please pass this message to Vandersay! In backyard cricket we do bowl off spin when leg spin doesn't come out as expected " I somehow never could bowl finger spin. It was leggies or bust!

4180,2ndInnings$6
4180,2ndInnings$Rajitha to Pooran, SIX runs, that's a clean strike. Maybe it's Pooran who'll take the lead today. Back of a length that sat up perfectly for Pooran, and he helped it into the breeze and well over midwicket. There was no stopping that, no matter where you place the fielder

4180,2ndInnings$34.1
4180,2ndInnings$1
4180,2ndInnings$Udana to Brathwaite, 1 run, rolled his fingers over it, and Brathwaite takes the single. That's the 50-partnership off 38 balls. Just eight coming from Brathwaite's bat. EIGHT!
4180,2ndInnings$kushansri: "These two slowly taking the game away.. if brathwite settled he can single handedly change result of the game... pooran is well settled.. is this going to be a another nail bitte?

4180,2ndInnings$W
4180,2ndInnings$Udana to Pooran, OUT, and that's out, I believe! What a way for Brathwaite to go! Pooran drove it down the ground, and Udana looks like he got a finger to it, before the ball hit the stumps. Brathwaite was well out of his ground. They have gone upstairs
4180,2ndInnings$Brathwaite is gone, the ball kissed Udana's long middle finger before thudding into the stumps. Unfortunate for the Windies

4180,2ndInnings$Udana to Allen, no run, misjudged the bounce on that cut shot and had himself beaten
4180,2ndInnings$Andy C: "Bee in bonnet here: you say the run out's 'unfortunate' but this mode of run out happens far too often in international cricket for that to wash. Why don't non-strikers back up trailing their bat for a quick reach back when the ball comes straight back? Could one of your stats team look at how often this dismissal happens? (And present the data to the coach of whichever is their favourite team)" Fair point, no arguments

4180,2ndInnings$4
4180,2ndInnings$Udana to Pooran, FOUR runs, gets that away! Touch of streakiness about that. Attempted a cut but got a nice outside edge that rolled past an absent first slip and towards the third man boundary

4180,2ndInnings$Malinga to Pooran, no run, slower wide yorker. Pooran can't get bat on it
4180,2ndInnings$Kaushik Gurumur: "How much is SL claiming the runout of Brathwaite within the spirit of the game? An unintentional finger on the way to the stumps. If it is within the spirit, why is mankading not? Atleast that is intentional and conscious, whereas this one is purely (un)luck." It is much too late in the day for me to indulge this debate

It's highly plausible to transfer those skills ... in the last 20 overs of an ODI, not the first 20 like the windies has been doing. They tended to bat strongly in the first 20 overs and fall away in the last 30. But if they were to play proper ODI cricket in the first 30 overs and apply T20 cricket to the last 20, then they would for sure be a force to be reckoned with "

This was flicked to short fine leg, and Pooran had ran across despite Allen not moving. Allen was ball-watching, and when he saw Pooran reach the other end, he scampered across to ensure that Pooran isn't run-out. Allen sacrifices his wicket, but did West Indies need to throw a wicket away at this stage? Probably not...
