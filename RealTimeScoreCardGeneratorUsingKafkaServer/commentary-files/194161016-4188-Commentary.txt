4188,1stInnings$Boult to Finch, OUT, length, and jags back into him and traps him in front! Just a bit of seam movement back into him, and Finch shakes his head as he walks off.

4188,1stInnings$Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, DROPPED! Full ball outside off, and Khawaja goes with the flow and has a dab at it, taking one hand off. It goes through to Guptill at the second of three slips, but he spills it as he falls

4188,1stInnings$7.6

4188,1stInnings$0
4188,1stInnings$Boult to Khawaja, no run, beats him again! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge
4188,1stInnings$10.3
4188,1stInnings$1
4188,1stInnings$Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, goes for the magic ball, pitching leg and swinging away to take the leading edge. No such luck as Khawaja flicks the ball on the pads to deep square leg
4188,1stInnings$10.4
4188,1stInnings$3
4188,1stInnings$Boult to Smith, 3 runs, goes round the stumps straight away to SS, who is only too happy to work with the angle and flick the fuller delivery from outside off down the ground past the right of the bowler
4188,1stInnings$10.5
4188,1stInnings$1
4188,1stInnings$Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot
4188,1stInnings$Jubair: "Honestly followed the match so that the Aussie openers don't score much and K Will gets out early. All so that my boy Shakib has easy access back to that number 1 spot for runs. GOOD JOB KIWIS!! Now, LET'S GO AUSSIES!!" #VestedInterests #UlterniorMotive #SHAKKIIIIBBBBB

4188,1stInnings$Boult to Smith, no run, stays over the wicket - with no mid-off - and pitches the ball up on middle stump. Smith springs across and then, after teasing all of us with those rubber wrists, only defends. Boooo!
4188,1stInnings$Shariq: "Amazing how someone bowling 6 overs on a trot is an extended spell nowadays. Clearly remember those days when 15 overs were the fielding restrictions and the first 2 bowlers used to consistently bowl 6 overs each on the trot. " --- The middle overs have become key in ODIs. And teams need a strike bowler to operate there
4188,1stInnings$11.1

4188,1stInnings$Ferguson to Smith, OUT, falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had 0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!

It comes off the bottom of Maxwell's blade as he looks to pull a short one outside off, and Neesham dives away to his left and picks up a one-handed grab. That's the kind of catch you would be tempted to take out for dinner, and take home to introduce to your parents. New Zealand are on fire!

And Australia have some incredible bowlers. A 200-type score could produce a proper contest here.

4188,1stInnings$deGrandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs, superb hit! And it's because he is basically pulling a good length ball outside off. You know, the kind you're told to bowl in Test cricket. Only here, this extremely talented left-hander picks up the length so early and also takes the extra credit points as well by hitting with a relatively straight bat to send the ball skimming past wide mid-on (can't cross-bat those balls because they're not short enough)

4188,1stInnings$Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs, outrageous! This is an attempted bouncer outside off. So pulling it carries risk. But Carey manages it beautifully by leaping off his feet, getting on top of the ball and hammering it away through wide mid-on.
4188,1stInnings$Quazi: "Supporting NZ because of KW. Getting furious on Carey steadily. Mate! Why you have to play like Mike Hussey Tofay? " --- That's a good comparison, really. Even Steve Waugh used it

I'm almost tempted to think he's been scared off it because there were two left-handers in the middle and the legspinner would be turning it into them.

4188,1stInnings$Boult to Khawaja, OUT, GONE THIS TIME! Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball. Vital half-century from Khawaja, though, as he acknowledges the crowd on his way out

It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!

This one though just pitches on a length and carries on with the angle, allowing him to play that favourite on the up drive
4188,2ndInnings$Martin Guptill, who pull off possibly the catch of the tournament, is walking through the Long Room with Henry Nicholls, who is on World Cup debut and playing out of position. New Zealand would back themselves to chase this and get into the semis. But it won't be easy and that's not just because of Australia's bowling attack either. Lord's has rolled out a very sporting surface. Right, here's Jason Behrendorff with two slips in

Trent Boult with the headline performance right at the end, but it was Lockie Ferguson's pace that rattled Australia right up top. Colin deGrandhomme did a great job, too, and it was down to a rearguard from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja, with a good little hand from Pat Cummins, that has lifted them to a fighting total. Still everything to play for here, surely? Al Muthu will be at the helm when we return for the New Zealand chase. Stick around till then!

4188,2ndInnings$Starc to Guptill, 1 leg bye, half an appeal from Starc as he gets a length ball to curl back into Guptill at pace. The right-hander is trapped. His front foot is too far across and he doesn't have the time to adjust. Only height saves him. These are nervy times.

4188,2ndInnings$Cummins to Guptill, no run, un-play-ABLE! Guptill recoils from a ball that pitches on off stump, back of a length, one he thinks he has covered with a back foot block but one that nips away off the pitch like it's nobody's business
4188,2ndInnings$Wonder if Finch pulled Behrendorff because the left-armer wasn't getting any swing and he knows he needs early wickets. He knows he needs Williamson and Taylor in here early

4188,2ndInnings$Starc to Nicholls, no run, 146 kph - no one bowls a full delivery at the stumps like Starc. That curl away when the ball leaves his hand. The curl in as it travels the pitch. Nicholls is aware of the danger and is playing with as straight a bat as possible

Guptill is caught with his front foot in the wrong place. The bat needs to come down around it and it can't make the journey in time. Australia think about the review, but they don;t go for it in the end. Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps

4188,2ndInnings$Praveen Jha: "Couple of days back someone here said it was mandatory that, after a dismissal, batsmen cross each other on the ground. Guptill and Taylor didn't." --- I think someone sold you a dummy, Praveen. They cross only if they physically cross, usually for a catch!

4188,2ndInnings$A slip in addition to short leg for Kane Williamson when he was on strike. Good captaincy from Finch in looking to buy some more wickets. They retain places for Taylor
4188,2ndInnings$14.3
4188,2ndInnings$1
4188,2ndInnings$Lyon to Taylor, 1 run, fuller, and he pulls out the sweep. A fielder in the deep for that, and he runs to his right and sends in a flat return

4188,2ndInnings$0
4188,2ndInnings$Lyon to Williamson, no run, DROPPED? Tossed up outside off, and he saw his chance to drive against the turn. May have taken a bit of the bat, and part of Carey's right pad through to first slip, where the fielder fails to hold on. Steve Smith in position there

4188,2ndInnings$17.3
4188,2ndInnings$1
4188,2ndInnings$Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run, DROPPED! Difficult chance through to Carey. This one from Behrendorff was an off-cutter, and moved away from Williamson, who chased it through.

4188,2ndInnings$Finch to Taylor, no run, steps down the pitch to try and whip the ball against the turn through midwicket, but turn is what Finch does, beating the closed face and hitting his pad
4188,2ndInnings$20.5
4188,2ndInnings$4
4188,2ndInnings$Finch to Taylor, FOUR runs, sweeps past short fine leg, the desperate dive doesn't work and New Zealand get a little bit of relief. Poor ball well down leg. Simple putaway, no fuss. And on we go

4188,2ndInnings$2
4188,2ndInnings$Stoinis to Williamson, 2 runs, misfield at midwicket - Carey, I think - and it allows Williamson to sneak a second after a well played tap, right under his eyes

4188,2ndInnings$Stoinis to Taylor, no run, opens the face as he meets a shortish ball outside off, looking for a single to third man, but backward point hasn't been clued in on that plan
4188,2ndInnings$21.6
4188,2ndInnings$1
4188,2ndInnings$Stoinis to Taylor, 1 run, gets it to dart away - the legcutter gripping off the pitch - and Taylor follows the ball, steering it to third man with soft hands .Still risky though. A little extra bounce and he could have been caught behind

4188,2ndInnings$22.6
4188,2ndInnings$2
4188,2ndInnings$Maxwell to Taylor, 2 runs, lovely placement. Taylor plants the ball between midwicket and deep square leg with a simple nudge off the pads and his partner is awake to the second run
4188,2ndInnings$Prasanna: "Can't leave it too late like Dhoni. Once a wicket falls. NZ will be in trouble. They need to attack the part timers. " --- Or you know, just rotate strike better

4188,2ndInnings$6
4188,2ndInnings$Stoinis to Williamson, SIX runs, lifts it over deep midwicket. A length ball on leg stump and Williamson decides to show off a bit. Sure I could have nudged it along the ground to square leg. Buuuuuut.... I'd rather hit the first six of the day. There! Boom!
4188,2ndInnings$Harin: "Finch is probably giving the part timers a roll in case they are needed for the semis. They've already qualified, so why not rotate those shoulders" Yyyeaaah, that sounds fair

You'll get 1 good one but maybe not 2. Great captaincy. Aussie will win this quite easily I predict. NZ missed their opportunity." --- I can see that point. But this is the partnership that New Zealand's entire ODI game revolves around. You'd think as an opposition, you'd want to break it before it gets going

4188,2ndInnings$Maxwell to Williamson, 1 run, plenty of flight, luring KW into a hard-hit cover drive that bursts through the hands at short cover to bring up 6000 ODI runs. The third fastest to the mark, three innings behind Kohli

4188,2ndInnings$4
4188,2ndInnings$Maxwell to Williamson, FOUR runs, over mid-off and into the boundary. Sure the ball is turning into him, but he gets a good stride going and there's plenty of width to free the arms

4188,2ndInnings$Starc to Williamson, 2 runs, slaps the short and wide delivery at 147 kph right through point, the timing good enough to draw the mistake from the fielder

4188,2ndInnings$Starc to Williamson, OUT, caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy

Australia did not have Starc and Cummins, Pakistan did not have Amir and Wahab when they both got smashed by England recently. That's just a couple of examples.

4188,2ndInnings$ Rahul. I agree completely. The volume of cricket has led to a dilution of quality since teams keep resting their main bowlers for those meaningless ODIs to keep them fresh for tests. That has led to a massive increase in averages for modern ODI batsmen, where more players average over 50 that at any time in history. You don't see the same in tests, where only 4-5 players average 50 plus. Partly due to excellent test pitches recently but a lot to do with the best bowlers being on the park. "

What Sachin did for Ind in '03, Finch/Warner are doing it here for Aus. In '03 when ever Aus batting faltered, their bowlers decimated the opposition. The same is being done by Indian Bowlers here.
