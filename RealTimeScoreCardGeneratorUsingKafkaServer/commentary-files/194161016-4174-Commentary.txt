4174,1stInnings$11:28am Hello again! The anthems are done, with both captains flashing big smiles at the end of their respective anthems. A wholesome, G-rated start on a gloomy day. A match at last. Here we go. Guptil and Munro in the middle. Hafeez will start, to try and trouble Munro, no doubt.
4174,1stInnings$And the anthems are about to start. For the first ten overs, here's Varun. Be good to him!
4174,1stInnings$We're closing in on the action now. Anthems are just moments away, and following that, we should have live action for you. To recap, Pakistan need to win to have a realistic chance of qualifying, while New Zealand, most likely already through, will mathematically guarantee it with two points today.

Did he expect it to swing back in? It didn't and by the end of this sequence, his hands are so far away from the body as he tries to drive through the off side. Amir wheels away into the leg side.

4174,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Latham, no run, Latham isn't interested in playing at anything not threatening his stumps at the moment. Happy to let this one go by, too
4174,1stInnings$Astute observation from out stats man Rajesh: Pakistan have bowled only 6 balls where New Zealand's batsmen haven't been in control, but they have picked up three wickets. In the entire tournament so far, the average in the first 10 overs is 14 not-in-control balls per wicket

4174,1stInnings$1
4174,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Williamson, 1 run, sharp single. Short ball, and Williamson keeps it down, and senses an opportunity for a run. Latham agianst Shaheen again. This should be fascinating

4174,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Latham, OUT, gone, this is much too good for Latham. Shaheen's on fire. Pitched on a length just outside off stump, and shapes away ever so slightly, taking the outside edge of Latham's bat as he attempts yet another defensive stroke. Never quite looked like getting a move on, and now New Zealand are four down. It might really be on!

4174,1stInnings$Jimmy Neesham's in.
4174,1stInnings$I promise, no one's ever going to trust process if Pakistan get through at England's expense. One team's done everything right for four years, while the other has looked nowhere near that level for at least the past two. And the latter's threatens to pip the former to the last four. Amazing drama.
4174,1stInnings$Muhammad Tahir: "I Know Kane's wicket is the key, but if Pak can keep getting wickets at the other end it would put pressure on him and make mistakes."

Narrowly misses off stump and is too much for Shaheen down at fine leg

4174,1stInnings$Shadab Khan to Williamson, OUT, has he got him? He's got him! Shadab Khan has done it! Length ball, dipping outside off and drawing Williamson forward. he stabs at it away from the body as it turns and gets big off the surface. A faint edge on it and keeper holds on. Lovely bowling but also uncharacteristically loose from Williamson, who was getting a bit weary outside off in the last 15-20 minutes. Still, it takes some doing to get him out there and Shadab has produced the perfect delivery. Just a lovely pace on that

4174,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Neesham, no run, yorker just outside off, looks to carve this through off side and is beaten on the inside edge. Pakistan have the faint idea that there's an edge on that. They don't review. But the umpires now have a discussion and they've sent it up...so they think he's got an edge. Soft signal is not out. Sarfraz took this quite low. 'Can't use Ultra Edge,' says the third umpire presumably because the bat is jamming into the turf as the ball passes it. So it will remain not out, without even going to the zoomer on whether that carried. Hang on. Now they're checking again... this one is possibly Pakistan's review. Not clear yet. But it does remain not out. Funnily, this time Ultra Edge IS used. Don't let anyone tell you they understand cricket in its entirety...

4174,1stInnings$4
4174,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to deGrandhomme, FOUR runs, smart! CDG knew where the fielders were. It was always going to be full from Amir and he waited deep in the crease. It also happened to be on leg stump so all he had to do was nudge this wide of short fine. Expertly done
4174,1stInnings$partheeban has mentioned here , it sounds impossible" --- The 2011 World Cup when Ross Taylor went bonkers...

4174,1stInnings$Wahab Riaz to Neesham, FOUR runs, dive but he can only parry it into the boundary to his right. Good effort from Fakhar running to his right at deep midwicket, but long-on was looking to help him out and won't be able to turn around and stop this. A good short too. Short ball at off stump and he pulled it right between those two fielders, off the front foot

Came back for a second that wasn't there. At least not for him. Sarfraz is in a poor position, right in front of the stumps, when he gathers this. But there's so much time to turn around, parry it onto the stumps and catch CDG short. A tame end to a very important innings

Inswinging yorker outside off, can do no more than slice it to sweeper cover. His throw comes in on the bounce and Wahab barely flaps out at it. Overthrows at midwicket

4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, good start. Movement in the air, pitched up, and only an inside edge saves a certain lbw
4174,2ndInnings$Welcome back. Danyal here, and I'll take you through the first ten overs as Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq look to take Pakistan through that same period without too much drama. The bowlers have - largely - done their job, and Pakistan will be bitterly disappointed if they come up short here.
4174,2ndInnings$The players have started to make their way onto the field, with the start about five minutes away.
4174,2ndInnings$Kumar Suresh: "My friend here in Auckland who plays for a local club says, "we play on these sort of wickets day-in-day-out during the end of our season. I see no reason why we wont win this." he reminds me of 2011 wc against SA. Defending low totals is in the genes of NZ. They thrive on it"
4174,2ndInnings$Burhan: "Well, I guess this is Good effort from NZ but at the toss Pakistan would happily get 237 at the end of First Innings :), Best of Luck Pakistan "
4174,2ndInnings$Syed: "NZ final score is more due to good sensible batting by 6th (wk)t partnership rather than poor bowling and poor fielding by Pakistan. Got to give credit where it is due...."
4174,2ndInnings$Anjan: "NZ not getting bowled out despite a big scare gives a soft signal of confidence to Pak fans about non existence of a monster in the pitch. Just a pressure handling game from now on I reckon "
4174,2ndInnings$Lakshman Kumar: "With Boult and Ferguson's good form, I feel NZ are 10-15 runs above par from the start they got..!"
4174,2ndInnings$Umer : "After getting Williamson, bringing back Imad waseem allowed De Grandhome and Neesham to set. Sarfraz needed to be more aggressive at that time."
4174,2ndInnings$Arif Hossain: "I have a feeling that Jimmy Neesham innings is going to be the decider tonight! "
4174,2ndInnings$Himash: "Jimmy Neesham did an Angelo Matthews today. Read the wicked and grinded it out to bring NZ to parity. Will be the decider. "
4174,2ndInnings$Jatin Goyal: "Irrespective of the result of today's game, NZ look a great team - 2 explosive openers, very stable 3 & 4, one wicket keeper batsman, 2 gritty allrounders, 4 good bowlers - perfectly balanced team on paper All they need is a belief that they can win the cup"
4174,2ndInnings$Ahsan: "It's not that hard to bat on i think pak will win in 43rd over inshallah "
4174,2ndInnings$imran: "50 runs of last 5 overs. pakistan need 238 to win. 85 runs in last 10 overs. once NZ were 83/5 n they managed to end as 237/6 6th wicket going down at 217. impressive comeback by NZ all rounders. neesham stayed not out 97. good luck pakistan"
4174,2ndInnings$SabbirChowdhury: "Neesham has missed his first ODI hundred by just three runs. And in the last over he scored 12 runs! All my sympathies!"
4174,2ndInnings$Meanwhile, there was delight for Bangladesh and despair for India in football today, as Dhaka Abahani reached the AFC Cup knockout stage at the cost of Chennaiyin FC in thrilling fashion. Debayan Sen, switching his attention to football today, describes how the drama unfolded.
4174,2ndInnings$3:20pm 'Once you realise you'll survive without the game, you'll enjoy it for what it is' - Jimmy Neesham's words talking about how he'd almost retired, partly because of missing out on the last World Cup. He found perspective, he found balance, and he finds himself at the end of a New Zealand innings that looked like it could have ended an hour ago. This is a top effort from him. Just a few short of a century, but he has kept New Zealand in the game along with Colin deGrandhomme. Kane Williamson was at it, doing the rescue briefly, but Pakistan had him early enough to cause some serious trouble. An epic show from them the first 30 overs, particularly from the two youngest bowlers in their line-up. They had New Zealand panicking. But we have some sort of parity now. 237 is by no means a scary total, and Mickey Arthur has just said he backs his batsmen to get it. But it is enough for New Zealand to come out more confident. I get the feeling we're in for a sensational game today.

4174,2ndInnings$Will Gill: "Everyone is thinking about NRR fo 4th spot, but the first tie-breaker is number of wins and right now England hold the advantage (they also have a far superior NRR anyway). I don't see the Poms missing the semis." Unless Pakistan or Bangladesh have a washout, neither number of wins or NRR should come into it. England just need to win 2 games. It's in their hands.

Big strides forward, big limbs reaching out, but the grace of a much smaller man as he dives and gets his fingers under this at point! And this following an absolute scorcher of a bouncer from Lockie, jumping up at Imam's grille from middle stump. Remember, he'd caused him problems in the UAE, even hit him on the head not so long ago. Goes straight for the bouncer option. Imam just fends at it with no clue and it pings off the shoulder of the bat. Just brutal fast bowling

4174,2ndInnings$Abhijato: "Babar needs to play within himself today. People tend to criticise him for his slow strike rate, but this chase is custom-built for him to anchor with a classical knock out of an ODI in the 90s. If he does win it for his team, the tournament table is going to open up furthermore, and the fourth playoff spot's occupation will become as unpredictable as this Pakistan team.."
4174,2ndInnings$And that'll be drinks. All in all a decent recovery after Imam's wicket.

4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, no run, beaten again. Santner is doing nicely here. Luring him in with plenty of flight. This one is wider. He looks to drive on the up

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, 1 run, squared him up with big turn from a middle stump line. Babar circumspect as he gets deep in the crease and closes the face on this. Leading edge goes past slip

4174,2ndInnings$18.5
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Neesham to Babar Azam, no run, leading edge trickles past the bowler. Slight mix-up as mid-on gets down at this, but he says no in time. Short of a length on leg, closes the face too early on the flick
4174,2ndInnings$18.6
4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Neesham to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, oh yes. More of that, sir. Short and up in the corridor and he plays just about the perfect square drive. Right on top of it, contact right under his eyes, elbow nice and high and the bat face not opened till it was required. Blazes to point's left
4174,2ndInnings$19.1
4174,2ndInnings$2
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Mohammad Hafeez, 2 runs, short and turning away outside off. Follows with his hands and gets this to sweeper's left. A poor throw from there, both in terms of delivery and choice. Babar was rooted as Hafeez came running back. Throw went to the keeper, which was probably the wrong option

4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Neesham to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, Neesham isn't quick enough to bowl that length. Short of a length, but sat up for Babar and begged to be spanked. Babar is too good not to oblige, and bludgeons it to he midwicket boundary

4174,2ndInnings$Williamson to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, and that's the most Hafeez way to get out!

4174,2ndInnings$Williamson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, good shot. Opens the face of the bat and scythes it past the man at 45, and sees it race down to the boundary. Williamson is easier to play for Haris, with the ball going away
4174,2ndInnings$28.3
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Williamson to Haris Sohail, no run, ripper. Turns Beats off stump, as well as the outside edge. This is the line

4174,2ndInnings$Williamson to Haris Sohail, no run, poor from Haris. Looks to drive on the up. Risky option, and lucky it doesn't take the edge

4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Williamson to Haris Sohail, no run, absolutely unplayable. Williamson is turning it around corners, too. I reckon that pitched on middle and Latham took it about a third of the way to the wide marker

4174,2ndInnings$Ash: "I think NZ can still take this home if they take couple of wickets here. For that fast bowlers need to bowl into the pitch, which hasn't happen."

4174,2ndInnings$Julian Branscom: "How different might it have felt for Pakistan if Boult came back a couple of overs earlier? Hindsight is often under-rated as a good captaincy trait." --- My guess is Williamson feels the extra pace is suiting these batsmen

Grips a shade as he gets forward but he's managed to extend the arms and place this drive past extra cover. It's not an easy shot on this pitch, even with the turn. The timing had to be perfect

4174,2ndInnings$39.5
4174,2ndInnings$2
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, 2 runs, misfield Guptill at extra cover. Full on off stump, harmlessly driven to extra cover and no run turns to two. He had the barrier and all, but this goes through

4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, no run, length at off stump, punched to extra cover where Guptill is on the floor to stop this

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, 1 run, short and a bit of width. Sliced clear of point and Matt Henry does well to cut it off

4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, no run, blocked, nearly chopped on by Babar. Boult bowling a little short
4174,2ndInnings$Prasanth: "This is just an awful spot to be in as a captain for Williamson. Needs wickets to have any shot at winning this. But the main strike bowler might leak a fifth of the remaining runs in one over."
4174,2ndInnings$40.3
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, no run, that's full but wide. Half-volley length, really. He's lucky Babar doesn't make him pay
4174,2ndInnings$40.4
4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, 1 run, bouncer that Babar guides down to midwicket. That's all Pakistan need. No heroics, no fireworks

4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, gorgeous touch from Haris. Just opened the face of the bat and got it sooo fine. Absolutely raced away, and third man had no chance. Six of what was shaping up to be a tight over
4174,2ndInnings$41.1
4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, short boundary towards midwicket, and Babar slog sweeps it right there. Didn't care about how much it might spin, just hit across the line and got it right in the middle of the bat

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Babar Azam, 1 run, and prods to short third man and scuttles down to the other end. Santner is being seen off, and somehow, he's wicketless

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Haris Sohail, 1 run, helped to the offside. Pakistan are, would you believe it, being sensible. SENSIBLE!!

4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, 1 run, whipped odwn to square leg. Right, New Zealand need to break through now. 2.4 overs of Boult and one from Santner left. I reckon we see Lockie soon now, too
4174,2ndInnings$42.3
4174,2ndInnings$2
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, 2 runs, too full and wide from Boult and stroked away to extra cover. Brilliant work from Colin Munro on the boundary to save four. Boult not quite hitting his lengths here

4174,2ndInnings$Santner to Haris Sohail, no run, sharp turn, but Haris fends him off

4174,2ndInnings$2
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, 2 runs, gets his cut away this time. Stops the boundary but Haris brings up his second consecutive half-century. Where was he all this while? Oh, warming the bench. How classically Pakistani
4174,2ndInnings$44.4
4174,2ndInnings$2
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, 2 runs, whipped away to the onside, and that brings up the 100-partnership. How crucial has this been for Pakistan, and how unlikely it looked when Santner weaved his magic in his first spell. The two most in-form batsmen for Pakistan look like they're guiding them home, keeping them alive
4174,2ndInnings$44.5
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, bouncer but doesn't quite have the fizz on it. Haris chooses not to bother with it

4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, magnificent. The confidence oozing through his veins. Drives Boult on the up through extra cover, as if people should do this to Boult all the time. Trickles down for four, and the fight is seeping out of New Zealand at last

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, short ball, upper-cut to third man. It's almost eerie how drama-free this chase suddenly is. This is the moment Pakistan tend to self-destruct

4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, spectacular. Princely! Babar pulls to cow corner and the ball absolutely gallops to the rope for four. Pakistan's MVP is on 99

4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, no run, excellent delivery, just seamed away and evaded Babar's drive. The crowd gasps. They're expectant, but also tense
4174,2ndInnings$46.5
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, no run, getting excited, was Babar. Looked to use his wrists and nudge it down to fine leg, but got a leading edge. Needs to keep his focus
4174,2ndInnings$46.6
4174,2ndInnings$0
4174,2ndInnings$Boult to Babar Azam, no run, straight to the fielder at cover-point. Babar will have to wait another over, at least. Good over from Boult, who is also bowled out. Began with much promise, but couldn't quite follow it up
4174,2ndInnings$47.1
4174,2ndInnings$4
4174,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, beautifully played. This is a 90mph bowler, but Haris had so much time. Opened the face of the bat and played it right under his nose, and sliced it through the backward point/third man gap

4174,2ndInnings$1
4174,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, and here it is! The 10th hundred for Babar Azam, and perhaps his most precious. Short and wide, and Babar slashes it away to deep cover before embracing Haris. The crowd goes wild, and every cheer is well deserved. The look on his face tells you how much it meant
4174,2ndInnings$47.4

4174,2ndInnings$7:45pm And that is all! Thanks for joining us through the day. Good night.
4174,2ndInnings$Sarfraz: The crowd is always behind the Pakistan team. Thank you very much. Fielding is a very important part. Unfortunately we didn't do well in the previous matches. We practiced hard. The way we played today, it was a great team effort. All the bowlers did really well and in the end Babar and Haris - one of the finest batting I've ever seen. We knew 240 was not an easy target on this pitch. We just wanted to bat 50 overs. Credit to Babar and Haris, the way they played on this pitch. [On 1992] when the World Cup starts, people think that way. But we're not thinking like that. Our focus is the next match. We are very confident and hopefully we'll do well.
4174,2ndInnings$Williamson: We've seen it in our last three games, where the surfaces have offered to the bowlers and made life difficult. We were outplayed by a strong Pakistan side. I think there was a little bit more bounce than we experienced on the same surface we played the other day. The fight that was shown in the middle and back end was good, to get us in a position where we were competitive. But that partnership with Babar and Haris, they took it from us. [Shadab] yeah it was nice wasn't it? We tried to soak it up. Thought if we get 230-250, there was a chance. And there was, but they soaked up the pressure and played really nicely. When the threat is spin, especially when the wicket became a lot slower, we were trying to get anybody in there who would rotate the ball. There's so many games in the round robin that you're not expecting to win them all. There's things we need to iron out. We'll have to adapt a little better than we did today.
4174,2ndInnings$Babar: This is my best innings. the wicket was difficult and turned a lot in the second half. The plan was to go through to the end and give my 100%. When we started, the plan was to see out Ferguson. But when Santner came on, the plan became not to give wickets to him and cover up later when the fast bowlers come on. The fans support us here in Birmingham, it's great. 
4174,2ndInnings$Babar Azam is the Man of the Match.
4174,2ndInnings$7:30pm Edgbaston explodes and the Pakistan players rush onto the field. They've copped an absolute truckload of criticism and been written off, but a comprehensive win over South Africa and a clinical one over NZ today have seen them storm back into contention!
4174,2ndInnings$Don't write them off just yet. They are one point behind England and level with Bangladesh. A mature chase, shepherded by a young man with a head far wiser than his 24 years would suggest. NZ suffer their first defeat of the 2019 World Cup, and their first group stage defeat in 8 years.
4174,2ndInnings$Mickey Arthur runs down the changing room with an arm around Shaheen Afridi, a wide grin on his face. His team is not going down without a fight, and that is all he;s asked of them.
