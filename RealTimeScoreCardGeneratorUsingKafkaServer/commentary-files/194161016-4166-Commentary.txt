4166,1stInnings$Hugh: "The issue with the slow starts for Australia is the balance of the batting to come. Khawaja and Smith can bat fluently but not explosively. If you have that cover to come you want your openers to get ahead of the rate then the next two can consolidate. Essentially Australia haven't been as proficient at accelerating the rate as India and the balance of batting seems confused."

No it's hitting! It was 'Umpire's call' hitting enough of leg stump! Decision stands. Bangladesh keep their review.
