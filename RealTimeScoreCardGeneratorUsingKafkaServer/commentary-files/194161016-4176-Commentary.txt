Clean catch on the replay. Excellent catch. Perera miscues a pull into the deep, Rabada misread it initially thinking he hit it better than he did. It dropped sharply. The big man run forward and plucked it just above the turf

4176,2ndInnings$2.43pm Umpires Ravi and Tucker take the field, and behind them come the Sri Lankans, who quickly form a huddle on the outfield. Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock are the last to take the field, and we're moments from the start of the chase. Lasith Malinga will bowl the first ball. De Kock will face it. Two slips behind him.

4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to Amla, no run, gentle shape away from the bat again, but Amla lets this one go past him and just has a look. Not a great deal of lift out of the track, and it dies on the way through to the keeper

4176,2ndInnings$4
4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to Amla, FOUR runs, four more! And a bit more oomph in this one as Malinga strays in to Amla's pads and is dismissively flicked to the midwicket boundary. Grace on the off side, power to leg

4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to Amla, no run, another yorker, and it's a slower one at just 117km/h, but Amla picks it and digs it out to point

4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to Amla, no run, beaten on the drive! Every so often, Malinga has found some shape away from the bat - especially when the ball is full, as this one is. Amla chases it with a drive, but he's beaten by the swing
4176,2ndInnings$Shahbaz: "Watching Malinga yorkers and smashing timbers feel of good old days of Wasim Waqar and Shoaib. "
4176,2ndInnings$6.6

4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to Amla, no run, Amla steps forward and angles his defensive push to guide a length delivery to point, covering a hint of movement away from him
4176,2ndInnings$Black Jeezus: "The Proteas were smart to go into this match with the extra batter. They bat all the way to 9 today, with Phehlukwayo, Pretorious and Morris in the line up. KG is no mug either, coming in at 10. " -- Yep, in these conditions those positions may well prove pivotal. This match is far from over

4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, no run, his first ball lands full, outside off, and Faf drives him to cover

4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, no run, this is a difficult track to really find your timing on, and Faf's attempted drive goes nowhere, his bat making a hollow, woody sound
4176,2ndInnings$7.4
4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, no run, dabbed down behind square on the off side, but not into space
4176,2ndInnings$7.5
4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, no run, glanced off the straight and into the leg side, but a sharp dive from Jeevan at midwicket saves runs. Sri Lanka are up for this, and they're looking smart in the field

4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to du Plessis, no run, Faf dabs a slower cutter down towards gully and wanders out, asking about a single, but he's sent back by Amla. And rightly so
4176,2ndInnings$Wajid Jawaid: "The poor weather has been a blessing in disguise in this tournament. The lack of preparation of pitches has ensured quality cricket giving bowlers a fair chance. Much better than seeing 350+ every other game" -- I'm not sure that's the reason, but I do agree that 350 in every game would soon become tiresome
4176,2ndInnings$8.5
4176,2ndInnings$2
4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to du Plessis, 2 runs, a very fine glide down to third man very nearly brings four, but the fielder down there puts in a dive to haul it back in just inside the boundary. Good work
4176,2ndInnings$8.6
4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$Malinga to du Plessis, no run, there's still a little outswing for Malinga, and the full-ish length is also a testing one. Faf is tested, but his forward defence holds firm

4176,2ndInnings$4
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to Amla, FOUR runs, dispatched this time! Again Thisara offered width, but this wasn't quite as short so Amla could very easily get on top of it to send a thundering drive out to cover point. Hit on the up, and very well
4176,2ndInnings$9.4
4176,2ndInnings$1
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to Amla, 1 run, nudged down behind square on the off side to turn the strike over

4176,2ndInnings$9.6
4176,2ndInnings$4
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, FOUR runs, aggression! Du Plessis presses the issue by getting down the track at Perera. A neat little two-step gets him right to the pitch, and a slashing square drive brings runs. It was in the air, but right in the gap, and raises South Africa's fifty
4176,2ndInnings$10.1

4176,2ndInnings$Lakmal to Amla, 2 runs, Lakmal searches for some outswing, but this one doesn't deviate and the ball slips in towards Amla's pads to be flicked neatly through midwicket
4176,2ndInnings$With the first Powerplay done, there's a change of ends for Lakmal. Amla, who has just reached 1,000 ODI runs in England, is on strike to him

4176,2ndInnings$Zain: "I don't think scoring over 350 can be boring, it's only boring if the chasing team gets nowhere near. For games to be interesting they generally need to go right down to the wire."

4176,2ndInnings$Lakmal to Amla, no run, Amla's on the drive, but he finds mid off
4176,2ndInnings$kunal: "Hi Liam Are SL bowlers looking threatening enough to pick 10 wickets with such a low total onboard? any demons in the pitch to assist them?" -- No demons, but it's not the quickest track and so could be difficult for the new batsmen to start on, especially as the match goes on
4176,2ndInnings$10.4
4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$Lakmal to Amla, no run, Lakmal floats one up full outside off, but Amla doesn't like the look of this one and leaves it alone

4176,2ndInnings$Lakmal to Amla, 2 runs, yet more width offered, and this time Amla does have a go. The ball comes off the toe-end and flies through point, the cover sweeper getting around to cut it off

4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to Amla, 2 runs, up and over mid off by Amla, who holds the pose, expecting the ball to travel easily to the boundary. But it lands and plugs in the boundary, coming to a complete stop, so they have to run them. Amla does so with a smile on his face
4176,2ndInnings$11.3
4176,2ndInnings$1
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to Amla, 1 run, full, wide and Amla finds a single with a thrashing drive out to the sweeper

4176,2ndInnings$1
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to du Plessis, 1 run, and now Faf is on the drive. Another good-looking shot, but it's straight to that cover sweeper
4176,2ndInnings$Vishwapati: "This is 11th innings in succession with sub 300 score. In a tournament where everybody was looking forward to series of 400+, this duel between bat and ball is refreshing to watch!"

4176,2ndInnings$0
4176,2ndInnings$NLTC Perera to Amla, no run, keeping a little low? This definitely didn't get up too much off the pitch, but Amla is right behind it and defends easily enough in the end
4176,2ndInnings$Zain: Getting right down the wire is fun but that doesn't address the imbalance. If the defending team's bowlers are benefiting from extraordinary scoreboard pressure, they are not relying purely on their own skill. In a 300plus game, the bowlers are reduced to bowling machines and that IS boring no matter whose side you are on!"
4176,2ndInnings$11.6

4176,2ndInnings$Lakmal to du Plessis, 1 run, quick single! Faf tapped it towards mid off and just set off. A direct hit might have been interesting
4176,2ndInnings$Vishnu : "I personally like wickets with 300 to 330 scores, not 400+ though. Those scores brings out ability to take single double along with ability to clear bounderies. And its fun to see accurate bowlers getting more rewards... For me, that is a perfect mixture... "

Dilshan and Herath followed, Malinga soon too.

4176,2ndInnings$BMAJ Mendis to Amla, no run, Given LBW! South Africa review. Amla looked happy to go but Faf talked him into reviewing. He tried to sweep and played over the top of it. Not bat involved. Amla is walking off already. Ball tracking says it pitched outside leg! That was always the query. It will be reversed. Amla has to walk back. Faf was correct. It pitched just outside leg. Only fractionally. It did look in doubt live but Amla thought it was out.
