4192,1stInnings$1w
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, 1 wide, wide outswinger on a fullish length, and Guptill gets down on his back knee and has a proper old slash at that. He's nowhere near connecting, and the umpire signals wide
4192,1stInnings$10.43am We've never really had a genuinely tense finish to a World Cup, and only a few truly competitive finals. 1979, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 were among the most one-sided ODIs of all time. Let's hope today's game is a final for the ages. Chris Woakes has the new ball, and Martin Guptill is on strike. Two slips in place. Let's go!
4192,1stInnings$0.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, no run, back of a length, close to off stump, a bit of shape away. Gets back and across and defends towards cover point
4192,1stInnings$0.2
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, no run, fuller this time, curves away from the fourth-stump line, left alone
4192,1stInnings$0.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, no run, back of a length, straightens towards middle stump. Gets on his toes to ride the bounce and defend back down the pitch
4192,1stInnings$0.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, no run, back of a length outside off, doesn't quite come onto the bat for the horizontal-bat slap. Hits it hard into the ground and it rolls slowly into the point region
4192,1stInnings$Interesting field. Big gap between cover point and mid-off.
4192,1stInnings$Mohit Bhartia: "Woakes starts with a wide! Shades of Zaheer Khan and the 2003 WC final. Just saying..."
4192,1stInnings$0.5
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, FOUR runs, first runs off the bat, and it's a boundary. Back of a length again, not too much width, and a bit of extra bounce. Looks to punch off the back foot and it hits high on the bat, near the outside edge, and runs away quickly to the left of Ben Stokes at backward point
4192,1stInnings$0.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, no run, back of a length, a little closer to off stump, left alone
4192,1stInnings$1.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, no run, length ball, straightens a little towards top of off, defended to midwicket
4192,1stInnings$Here's Jofra Archer, over the wicket to the left-handed Henry Nicholls.

4192,1stInnings$1.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, no run, back of a length on off stump, gets behind it to tuck it towards square leg. He wants one - the fielder is pretty much on the edge of the circle - but Nicholls sends him back
4192,1stInnings$1.4
4192,1stInnings$2
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, 2 runs, length ball, nips back a little towards middle stump, worked away to the left of long leg
4192,1stInnings$1.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, no run, got him, what a beaut! Or did he edge that at all? Squared him up in defence with late movement from the shorter side of a good length, on a tight off-stump line. Replays show the ball has sneaked past the outside edge and hit the pocket of Guptill's trousers on the way to the keeper. England trust in Marais Erasmus' not-out decision and decide not to review, wisely so.
4192,1stInnings$1.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, no run, length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler

4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, slants this one across, pitching just outside off on a fullish length. No swing back in, and Nicholls ignores it
4192,1stInnings$2.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, ooh, this one does come back in, and Kumar Dharmasena doesn't wait too long to raise his finger to Woakes' lbw appeal. Nicholls reviews. Lovely length, fullish but not full enough to bring out a proper front-foot stride, and Nicholls is stuck on the crease, playing down the wrong line, looking for the straight-bat defensive push to mid-on. Beats the inside edge, and hits back thigh pad. The ball pitched on a middle-and-leg line, and straightened, but the bounce would have taken it over the stumps, according to ball-tracking. Wow!
4192,1stInnings$2.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, length ball, straightening towards middle and off. Gets in half a stride this time and defends, with ball hitting the inside half of the bat
4192,1stInnings$2.5
4192,1stInnings$2
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, 2 runs, a touch shorter on off stump, worked away with the swing through square leg
4192,1stInnings$2.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, back of a length, this one keeps going with the angle, pitching on middle and finishing just outside off stump. Gets nicely back and across to defend into the covers
4192,1stInnings$Greg: "We always focus on the players, buy umpire Erasmus has had an an incredible world cup as well. That was an excellent decision under pressure - even the TV coverage added a '1' to the wicket column immediately, but Erasmus stood firm."
4192,1stInnings$3.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, no run, back of a length, a bit of nip back towards off stump, defended into the on side off the back foot

4192,1stInnings$6
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, SIX runs, digs this in short, rising shoulder high outside off, and Guptill stays leg-side of the ball, lets the ball come to him, and deliberately slices underneath the ball to uppercut over the boundary fine of third man
4192,1stInnings$Like for Woakes, a big gap between cover point and mid-off. The length, you'd expect, will be on the shorter side.
4192,1stInnings$3.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, no run, back of a length outside off, left alone
4192,1stInnings$3.4
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, FOUR runs, wham. A shimmy out of his crease this time, and he converts Archer's length ball into a half-volley, and extends his arms through the line to drive it back past the startled bowler, at shoulder height
4192,1stInnings$3.5
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, 1 run, length ball, angling into middle and leg, tucked away to fine leg
4192,1stInnings$3.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, 1 run, length ball on leg stump, stays on the back foot and pushes to the left of midwicket, with a straight bat, for a quick single

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, 1 run, shortish outside off, jumps up to ride the bounce and chops it down to third man
4192,1stInnings$4.3
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, 1 run, fullish, angling into middle stump. Guptill comes forward and plays a little uncertainly, looking to clip through the leg side while playing for a bit of outswing. Doesn't swing, and a thick inside edge runs away towards long leg
4192,1stInnings$Devi: "MSD in 2011 was out of sort in WC until he walked in to the folklores in the finals; can Guptill repeat ?" -- Gilchrist in 2007 is another example.
4192,1stInnings$4.4

4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, length ball attacking the top of off stump. Gets back and across to defend into the covers
4192,1stInnings$5.1
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Guptill, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to tuck it into the short midwicket region and they immediately set off for the single, with the bowler having to run across and field it himself

4192,1stInnings$5.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, no run, good ball, a bit of movement in from just short of a length. Pitches on about leg stump and straightens from there. Looks to work it through the leg side and the ball beats his inside edge and hits thigh pad
4192,1stInnings$Abir Utsha: "Can we check for squash balls in Guppy's gloves?"
4192,1stInnings$5.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, 1 run, similar ball, back of a length and straightening towards middle and leg. Tucked away to the left of midwicket this time
4192,1stInnings$6.1
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, 1 run, length ball, swings back in late, towards middle and leg, as Nicholls looks to push forward and defend. Inside-edge onto pad, and runs away wide of second slip

4192,1stInnings$W
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Guptill, OUT, Given! And Guptill consults with his partner for an age before reviewing with a couple of seconds left on the clock. Length ball, nips back in off the seam, and Guptill, looking to drive on the up through mid-off, is beaten on the inside edge. Hits the bent back leg, just above the flap of the pads. Impact is in line with middle and off, and the ball is hitting middle stump two-thirds of the way up. Why did he review that if there was no edge? Chris Woakes gets the first wicket of the World Cup final, with a lovely delivery that went off the seam in the opposite direction to how he usually swings it
4192,1stInnings$MJ Guptill lbw b Woakes 19 (30m 18b 2x4 1x6) SR: 105.55

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Williamson, no run, greets him with a fifth-stump outswinger, and Williamson gets on the front foot and leaves it alone
4192,1stInnings$Here he comes again, Kane Williamson. Three slips in place, and only two fielders on the leg side: fine leg and mid-on. Wow.
4192,1stInnings$6.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Williamson, no run, again the line is fifth stump. A good-length ball with a bit of late outswing, and Williamson won't be tempted into playing at it
4192,1stInnings$6.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Williamson, no run, length ball angling into off stump, defended off the front foot into the point region
4192,1stInnings$6.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Williamson, no run, ooh, lovely. This one's not as full as the previous ball, and it's pitched in the fourth-stump channel. Williamson is unsure whether to play or leave, and he kind of ends up halfway between the two as the ball straightens past his outside edge
4192,1stInnings$7.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, no run, shortish, and there's some extra bounce at 145kph. Straightens into Nicholls from a middle-and-leg line, and the ball beats the inside edge of his defensive bat and hits him on the stomach

4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, 1 run, back of a length, close to off stump. Jumps back and across to defend, and the ball straightens and hits the inside half of the bat and rolls gently between his legs. He has no idea where the ball is, but Williamson calls for a quick single and he immediately responds
4192,1stInnings$7.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, no run, short ball, rising to shoulder height in the corridor outside off, Williamson leaves it, swaying his upper body out of the way
4192,1stInnings$7.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, no run, ooh, that's massive outswing, most of it after passing the edge. Lovely length, fourth-stump line, and Williamson is half-forward to defend, and the ball swings past the edge and then swings some more before reaching the keeper
4192,1stInnings$7.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, no run, bouncer, rising steeply and without apparent effort over middle and off. Ducks his head and shoulders hurriedly out of the way

4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, no run, length ball close to off stump, defended with soft hands into the cover point region. Thinks of the quick single, but the fielder rushing in makes him decide against it
4192,1stInnings$8.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, length ball slanting across to off stump, defended to mid-off. Not much footwork there, just played that from the crease while staying nice and compact

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, this one isn't compact at all. Back of a length, widish line outside off, and he has a big slash at it away from his body and misses
4192,1stInnings$8.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, no run, back of a length, straightens into the fourth-stump channel, gets back and across for the straight-bat punch down the pitch
4192,1stInnings$8.4
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Nicholls, 1 run, overpitched, but Nicholls can't find the gap with his drive. Hits it to the right of mid-off, not far enough to beat him, and sets off for a quick single. Has to stretch at the end to beat Roy's throw at the non-striker's end. Doesn't hit the stumps and he'd probably have been just in anyway
4192,1stInnings$8.5
4192,1stInnings$0

4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, 1 leg bye, this isn't the easiest pitch to bat on. Back of a length, straightens into Nicholls from a leg-stump line with a bit of extra bounce. Beats the inside edge of his attempted flick and hits him on the thigh pad
4192,1stInnings$9.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, no run, length ball wide of off stump, looks like the offcutter, but it pitches too wide to make Williamson play

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Williamson, 1 run, length ball angling into off stump, leans forward and meets the ball right under his eye to tuck it gently to the right of midwicket
4192,1stInnings$9.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Nicholls, no run, appeal for lbw, and Nicholls shows the umpire his bat. Bounce may have taken it over the stumps too. Pitches just short of a length on middle or thereabouts, and straightens in past the back-foot defensive. May have kissed inside edge through to thigh pad

4192,1stInnings$Deepankar DM: "Guptill's intent, 'few' runs, Nicholls excellent review, and the survival of the openers till 7 overs ensured this is a 50-50 start as opposed to a usual horror start. England seemed a little flat early, as did India few days ago. These little things can be so so useful in such situations. NZ winning these moments in the SF led to their eventual victory. Could be crucial in this match too! " -- England certainly haven't been flat from what I've seen of them. The ball's been nibbling around and they've been pretty accurate, though the TV commentators have pointed out that Archer could have been a little fuller - none of the balls he's bowled so far would have gone on to hit the stumps, by the estimation of ball-tracking.

4192,1stInnings$Wood to Williamson, FOUR runs, short, angling down leg but not as far. A little shorter than the previous ball too, and Williamson swivels to hook it fine, to the left of the keeper. I suspect it came off glove, but Williamson won't mind that

4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Nicholls, FOUR runs, short and slanting into the hips from round the stumps, Nicholls sizes up this one on the back foot. Swivel-pulled away to the left of deep square leg. Has the sliding Stokes done his half at the boundary?
4192,1stInnings$11.57am Thanks, KK. Hello, again, everyone. England's seamers kept pegging away around off - and outside off - with the new ball but Nicholls and Williamson rode out that phase. The semi-new ball is still nibbling around, how will Williamson and Nicholls go? A steady diet of singles and improved their scoring rate, though. Here is Plunkett from round the wicket
4192,1stInnings$Asif Mujawar : "While I've always admired Kohli's ability to absorb the pressure and his game awareness which comes good 8/10 times, it's the big pressure games like ICC Knockouts he'll have to learn so much from Williamson in terms of reading the situation, staying calm in adverse and pressure situations and more importantly leading from the front. He's been failing in ICC knockouts for quite a long time now."

4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Williamson, OUT, Plunkett thinks he has Williamson. Umpire Dharmasena does not budge. Morgan wants a review. Good length, angling in towards off from over the wicket, kicking up and nipping away outside off. Williamson is undone by the cross-seamer as he drives at it fairly away from his body. Replays indicate that the ball moves away just enough, scratches the outside edge and Buttler gobbles that up. Plunkett returns to the attack and claims the prize scalp of Williamson. That's why England pick him ahead of Moeen

Length ball angling in from wide of the crease, and Taylor, shuffling across his crease, misses one as he plays around his front leg looking to work the ball square on the leg side. To me it seemed to bounce a fair amount, and it struck him above the knee-roll. Would that have hit the stumps? Marais Erasmus thought it would have... Ball tracking says it would have missed the top of leg stump.
4192,1stInnings$LRPL Taylor lbw b Wood 15 (47m 31b 0x4 0x6) SR: 48.38
4192,1stInnings$Wood returns to the attack.
4192,1stInnings$Suvadip : "I know you can't publish this but I must say, what a pale end to this exciting WC. This is not a thrilling contest by any means. Two teams having best points till semis should qualify for finals." -- This isn't dissimilar to how New Zealand's innings went against India, and we know how thrilling that game got towards its finish. And not sure why I can't publish it?

4192,1stInnings$33.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, no run, back of a length, angling into the batsman, who's standing on leg stump and not really going across his crease. Looks to work it leg side and misses, and the ball hits his thigh pad
4192,1stInnings$33.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, no run, beauty. Angling into the fourth-stump channel and holding its line. Neesham again stays leg-side of the ball and looks to jab at it. The ball sneaks past his outside edge
4192,1stInnings$34.1
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Latham, 1 run, length ball outside off, with a bit of extra bounce. Slapped away to deep point

4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, no run, full-toss, about stump high, angling into leg stump. England are looking to deny Neesham any room here, they know he's looking to stay leg side of the ball, so they're angling it into his body. Is a little surprised by that ball and looks to jab it away, but can't put bat to ball and is hit on the thigh pad
4192,1stInnings$34.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, no run, back of a length outside off, chopped into the point region
4192,1stInnings$34.4
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, FOUR runs, too full on the legs, and Neesham clips it away neatly, leaving deep square leg sprawled on the floor after chasing to his right on the boundary
4192,1stInnings$34.5
4192,1stInnings$1w
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, 1 wide, full, angling down leg, Neesham steps across and misses the flick

4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, FOUR runs, short ball, sits up at chest height outside off, and Neesham pounces on it. Opens up at the hip and pulls it away between mid-on and midwicket. Top shot
4192,1stInnings$34.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Stokes to Neesham, 1 run, full, on middle stump, gets his front leg out of the way and drives with a straight bat to the right of mid-on

4192,1stInnings$35.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, no run, bouncer rising over off stump, and Neesham gets out of the way, bending at the knees and pulling his head and shoulders away from the line
4192,1stInnings$35.4
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, 1 run, short outside off, pulled to the right of deep square leg, and now he pulls off a good diving save. Woakes the fielder
4192,1stInnings$35.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, fullish outside off, not quite up there for the cover drive. Straightens a bit and beats the angled bat of Latham
4192,1stInnings$35.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler

4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, no run, shortish, not too much width outside off to free the arms, jabbed to backward point
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett comes back now, from over the wicket.
4192,1stInnings$Vishal: "In my opinion this is a very interesting game, great batting early on with England bringing it back with the ball. If New Zealand get 260+ they are probably above par with the element of the pressure of a final and their bowling attack."

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, 1 run, back of a length, straightens in towards middle stump. Probably another of those cross-seam balls. Jabs his bat down and the ball hits the inside half of it and drops a short distance away on the leg side. Latham calls quickly for the single, and Neesham responds immediately
4192,1stInnings$36.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Latham, no run, slower length ball on off stump, lets it come on and dabs towards backward point
4192,1stInnings$36.4
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Latham, FOUR runs, wow. That's back of a length, gets up to waist height on middle stump, and this is more of a flick than a pull from Latham, picks it up and dumps it one-bounce, over the backward square leg boundary
4192,1stInnings$36.5
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Latham, 1 run, full now, on middle stump, clipped gently into the leg side, asking Archer to run in a fair distance from mid-on
4192,1stInnings$36.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, no run, back of a length on middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and jabs into the backward point region
4192,1stInnings$37.1
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, FOUR runs, shot of the innings. Length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and he takes a small step forward, and transfers his weight perfectly into a checked push to the right of extra-cover that leaves deep point attempting a futile sprint to his left
4192,1stInnings$Wood continues from round the wicket.
4192,1stInnings$Pratik: "Similarities with 2015 WC final. Ross Taylor fell at 35 overs to make it 150/4, which triggered a collapse! Hope they do better this time around."

4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, excellent response. Similar length, but a touch shorter, and it straightens off the seam to beat the outside edge as Latham looks for another front-foot push
4192,1stInnings$37.3
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, 1 run, back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man
4192,1stInnings$37.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, no run, back of a length, again it nips away slightly off the seam in the corridor. Neesham watches it well and plays late, dabs to backward point
4192,1stInnings$37.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, no run, good bouncer, only gets up to about neck height over off stump, and Neesham has to duck in a hurry to get under it
4192,1stInnings$37.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Neesham, 1 run, length ball on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs it away to deep point
4192,1stInnings$Slip has been in place for Neesham through this over, by the way.
4192,1stInnings$38.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, no run, ooh, that's not a great shot. Not short enough to pull, and it's too close to off stump to be playing across the line like that. Wasn't too far away after he missed
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett continues from right-arm over.

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Latham, 1 run, length ball slanting away from off stump, punched off the front foot to deep point
4192,1stInnings$38.4
4192,1stInnings$2
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, 2 runs, length ball angling away from off stump, opens his bat face and glides it fine of third man
4192,1stInnings$38.5
4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, FOUR runs, back of a length, pretty close to off stump, and Neesham plays that really well. Stands tall and forces it away to the right of extra-cover. Didn't have much room to free his arms, but he's easily beaten deep point to his left
4192,1stInnings$38.6
4192,1stInnings$W
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Neesham, OUT, boundary, wicket. There's that Plunkett cross-seamer that doesn't quite come onto the bat as expected. Fullish on off stump, but it sits up a little off the pitch, and Neesham just doesn't time that attempted loft over mid-on. Comes off the bat with a weird clunk, and Root takes a straightforward catch at mid-on. Three wickets now for Plunkett. What a final he's having.
4192,1stInnings$JDS Neesham c Root b Plunkett 19 (28m 25b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.00

4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 2 runs, back of a length outside off, deGrandhomme is off the mark with a chop to the right of third man
4192,1stInnings$39.3
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, no run, that ball is the definition of 'hard length'. It's pitched outside off, and deGrandhomme swivels into a pull, but it hits the bat jarringly high, and rolls gently to midwicket instead of pinging away to the boundary
4192,1stInnings$39.4
4192,1stInnings$2
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 2 runs, full now, on middle and leg, clipped away with terrific timing to the right of deep square leg, where Bairstow makes a super diving save
4192,1stInnings$39.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, no run, back of a length, nips back in off the seam. Looks to dab into the off side for one, but ends up inside-edging into his thigh pad
4192,1stInnings$39.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 1 run, fullish, close to off stump, jabbed to the left of extra-cover
4192,1stInnings$40.1
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to deGrandhomme, no run, back of a length, nips away like a legcutter in the corridor. No footwork from deGrandhomme, pokes at it and the feet follow after the ball has gone past his outside edge
4192,1stInnings$William: "Technically Roy could beat Sachin's record by scoring 248. Or for that matter so could Boult by scoring 600 odd off a whole lot of no balls..."
4192,1stInnings$Ten overs to go. Can New Zealand score 80-odd off those 60 balls? A fifth fielder can go out on the boundary now. Plunkett continues.

4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to deGrandhomme, no run, bouncer over off stump, and deGrandhomme, who had initially shuffled across to get into position to hook, decides in the end to duck
4192,1stInnings$40.3
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to deGrandhomme, 1 run, slower ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to Latham, 1 run, short ball angling away from off stump, pulled to deep midwicket. That's the extra fielder on the boundary - and two successive balls have been hit there, once by the right-hander and once by the left-hander
4192,1stInnings$40.5
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to deGrandhomme, no run, lovely slower ball, back of a length close to off stump. Again there's no feet from deGrandhomme, pushes at it and misses
4192,1stInnings$40.6
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Plunkett to deGrandhomme, no run, ooh, well bowled. Fuller now, another legcutter, pitching on off stump. CdG looks to whip through midwicket, and at the last moment checks himself, and the ball squirts along the ground to short cover off the leading edge. End of a fantastic, and possibly match-defining 10 overs from Plunkett
4192,1stInnings$41.1
4192,1stInnings$1

4192,1stInnings$41.2
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Archer to deGrandhomme, no run, another legcutter beats the leaden-footed deGrandhomme's outside edge. Back of a length, in the corridor, and he simply pushes at it with his hands
4192,1stInnings$41.3
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to deGrandhomme, 1 run, ouch! Follows up with a slippery short ball on off stump. Gets up above the right shoulder, and deGrandhomme top-edges his hook into the top of his helmet, just above the badge, and the ball pops up in the air but safely to the left of backward point. Out comes the physio to check on deGrandhomme
4192,1stInnings$41.4
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Latham, 1 run, full, angling away from off stump, driven to the right of mid-off

4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Archer to deGrandhomme, 1 run, full on off stump, driven firmly and straight to mid-off, and they chase the quick single anyway. Makes it safely to the danger end in the end
4192,1stInnings$41.6
4192,1stInnings$1w
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Latham, 1 wide, slower ball, full, ends up outside leg stump, and Latham swings too early through the attempted flick

4192,1stInnings$42.3
4192,1stInnings$4lb
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 4 leg byes, ooh, that's a difficult bouncer to deal with. Wide of the crease, angling into the stumps, and in the end it only probably gets up to shoulder height, and deGrandhomme ducks a(wk)wardly. Hits his left shoulder and ricochets beyond the reach of the keeper trying to leap up to his left with one glove extended. Evasive action, so it counts as leg byes
4192,1stInnings$Hk: "All the talk about English batting order being the most dangerous, I think their bowlers have been equally brilliant."
4192,1stInnings$42.4
4192,1stInnings$2
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 2 runs, drifts onto the pads and he clips it away towards long leg. They see it's Rashid fielding it and immediately decide on running two. The throw isn't the strongest, and Buttler has to leave his post by the stumps to collect it on the bounce
4192,1stInnings$42.5
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to deGrandhomme, 1 run, slower ball, back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man
4192,1stInnings$42.6
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, 1 run, shuffles across to off stump and Wood slants his short ball wider. Has to fetch the pull from outside off, from shoulder height, and he hits it uppishly, but fortunately for him without too much power, so it doesn't carry anywhere near deep midwicket coming in off the boundary

4192,1stInnings$43.3
4192,1stInnings$1

4192,1stInnings$Archer to deGrandhomme, no run, digs it in short outside off, extra bounce imperils the flat-bat slap, and he top-edges it, but the ball doesn't balloon far enough for Stokes, running in from point, to be able to catch it

4192,1stInnings$1lb
4192,1stInnings$Archer to deGrandhomme, 1 leg bye, he's hit on the back for the second time this over. Another slower short ball outside off, and again he swings too early on the pull. Runs away to third man for a leg bye
4192,1stInnings$43.6
4192,1stInnings$1w
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Latham, 1 wide, attempts the yorker this time, ends up bowling it down the leg side, past the attempted flick

4192,1stInnings$1w
4192,1stInnings$Archer to Latham, 1 wide, third wide of the over. Bouncer, Latham ducks, but it's the line that's the issue - outside leg - rather than the height

4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, slower length ball, angling away from off stump. Looks to step across and swipe it away through midwicket, but the angle only allows him to play it to mid-on

4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, hits that hard length and slants it away from off stump. Can't drive, can't pull, so he ends up playing an in-between diagonal bat swat, and can't put bat to ball
4192,1stInnings$44.3
4192,1stInnings$6
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, SIX runs, what a shot. A touch too full this time, on leg stump, and he clears his front leg slightly and whips it up and over wide long-on
4192,1stInnings$44.4
4192,1stInnings$0
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, no run, another blow to the body. Slower short ball, swivels through the pull too early and is hit on the stomach
4192,1stInnings$44.5
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Wood to Latham, 1 run, bouncer, gets over shoulder height and he hooks a little uppishly, but into the gap to the right of fine leg. deGrandhomme wants the second, he's sent back, and a more accurate throw to the keeper might have ended his innings. As it happened, Buttler had to run towards the silly point area to collect, and then he spun around and threw the stumps down, and the batsman was juuuust in
4192,1stInnings$Given how hard the slower bouncer has been to score off, or even connect, I expect Lockie Ferguson and Neesham to bowl a lot of them today

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to deGrandhomme, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, looks to work it wide of mid-on, initially, but adjusts once the ball straightens off the seam. Off the leading edge towards backward point
4192,1stInnings$46.4
4192,1stInnings$1
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Latham, 1 run, shuffles across early and Woakes slants a slower length ball wider outside off. Swiped away to deep square leg

4192,1stInnings$W
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to deGrandhomme, OUT, another slower ball, on the fuller side of a good length on off stump, and deGrandhomme's struggle ends. Looks to whip it over mid-on, plays too early, and balloons a leading edge to mid-off instead

4192,1stInnings$Ashutosh Sahoo: "This World Cup is turning out to be a battle of philosophies in a game format that's in a state of flux with the advent of T20 and facing existential challenges. There are two clear approaches - the classic approach and the hybrid ultra-modern approach.The classic approach, pioneered and practiced to perfection by India and followed by A/NZ, banks on solidity and conservation of resources. The threat of an under-par total is subverted by the odd impact players like Pandya/CDG/Maxwell. The hybrid approach is to stay on overdrive throughout the course of the innings but ameliorate the risks through multidimensional team selection giving inordinate depth to the batting order and by having one anchor player (like J Root or Shai Hope). Pioneered by England ever since their 2015 WC debacle, tried out by WIndies with sporadic success, this approach is an alluring future to the game of cricket but at the cost of the bowlers' graveyard."

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Latham, 1 leg bye, appeal for lbw as Latham looks to shuffle across and whip it leg side. Probably pitched outside leg, I reckon, but England have reviewed. The batsmen sneaked a risky leg bye, and Latham would have been out at the non-striker's end, by a number of feet, had Woakes hit direct, but he missed. Yup, it's pitched well outside leg stump.

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Latham, 5 wides, slower bouncer wide of leg stump, and it's run away for five wides. Latham had no option but to leave it, and the ball bounced a second time before reaching Buttler, who'd sidestepped to his right to get behind the ball, only for it to beat him with turn
4192,1stInnings$48.3
4192,1stInnings$W
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Latham, OUT, gone, a third wicket for Woakes. England haven't allowed the lofted hits over mid-on/mid-off/extra-cover, and this slower ball, which ends up as a low full-toss outside off stump, is also a hard one to put away. Hits low on the bat as Latham looks to go over mid-off, but he only succeeds in spooning it to the fielder. He goes for 47 - a scrappy innings, which could prove valuable for New Zealand if this pitch remains two-paced

4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Santner, 1 no ball, whoops, high full-toss, and Woakes will get a warning for this. Slanting across the left-hander, ends up hitting Santner's left shoulder as he aims to swat it away into the leg side

4192,1stInnings$4
4192,1stInnings$Woakes to Henry, FOUR runs, boom! A rare ball in the slot, angling into off stump, and he clears his front leg and wallops it over midwicket, one bounce and over the rope. Most of England's other 'full' balls have been off-pace, and/or too full to get underneath

4192,1stInnings$Archer to Santner, 1 run, in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and stabs to extra-cover. Another risky single - they have to take all of them - and another failure to hit the stumps. Santner has to slide home, and he may have hurt himself in the process. Seemed a little worse for the wear initially, but he looks okay

4192,1stInnings$Archer to Santner, no run, ha. Kind of sums up the latter half of New Zealand's innings, this ball. Santner ducks under a slower bouncer over leg stump. Then he thinks of stealing a bye and decides against it. Archer is just so deceptive, you can't blame Santner for it

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Roy, no run, gone first ball? No? Marais Erasmus doesn't think it's out, but that looked pretty close, and New Zealand have reviewed... It's the trademark Boult inswinger from left-arm over, past Roy's attempt at a straight-bat drive to mid-on. No inside edge... Pitching on around middle stump, and it's umpire's call on leg stump! Roy survives. Just. What saved him, I think, was that he was playing with a straight bat. If he'd gone further across with his front leg and played across it, the umpire might have been more inclined to give it out
4192,2ndInnings$3.10pm We're back. England need 242 to wrap their hands around the World Cup trophy for the first time. If New Zealand can stop them from getting there, they become first-time champions. Trent Boult has the first new ball, and the barnstorming opening pair of Roy and Bairstow, Boy and Rairstow, are in the middle. Just one slip in place for Boult, and a short, catching square leg for the uppish flick off the inswinger. Interesting.

4192,2ndInnings$Quite apart from this World Cup final, there is plenty of unmissable sporting action going on elsewhere this Super Sunday. Why not follow the latest from the British Grand Prix at Silverstone or Federer vs Djokovic in the Wimbledon final?
4192,2ndInnings$Tahir Abbas: "The outcome of this game relies heavily on the first spells of Boult, Henry and Ferguson. If they have a say, its game on with this score."
4192,2ndInnings$Mahota: "The hell you cannot blame Santner for leaving this last one. He at least should have tried." -- Try facing a 110kph slower bouncer from a 145kph bowler with a highly deceptive action, and tell me if you pick every pace and length variation. It was a damn good ball, and most of batting is instinctive reaction, and that was what happened with Santner.
4192,2ndInnings$Lakshitha: "In the 1996 world cup final, Australia scored 241 against Sri Lanka, and the Lankans went onto chase that down with ease..."
4192,2ndInnings$Liam Plunkett: "It's a good pitch. We thought we bowled tight lines to restrict New Zealand. Try and get as much out of the pitch with my variations. That's my role. I use the cross-seam ball more than the seam-up."
4192,2ndInnings$2.43pm Well, then. Started out as a greentop, and then it slowed down considerably. There was movement off the pitch throughout for the bowlers who hit the deck, and the slower balls gripped and did unpredictable things. England's romp in their semi-final might suggest they're overwhelming favourites to chase this down, but I have a feeling it won't be as easy as that on this pitch. None of the New Zealand batsmen really looked fluent today, and England might have a scrap on their hands too.

4192,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Morgan, no run, full now, and Morgan plays around it while attempting to flick. No lbw appeal, because it pitched outside leg.

4192,2ndInnings$Kiran Bhanushal: "The ball from CdG to get Root was at best an average delivery. But the cricketing sense from CdG to float a juicy away swinging half volley at that precise point to tempt Root was cricketing sense at its finest. 29 balls for 7 runs, under pressure to feel ball on bat, swung wildly the previous ball. As an allrounder CdG must have smelled that desperate feeling on Root!"

4192,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Bairstow, OUT, bowled 'im! Back of a length, close to off stump, too close to be trying to force away square on the off side. Jumps up to ride the bounce, jabs at it with an angled bat, and inside-edges onto his stumps. Ferguson now has more middle-overs wickets than any other bowler at this World Cup.

4192,2ndInnings$Ferguson to Morgan, no run, that's a brute of a bouncer at 145kph, and it nearly decapitates Morgan as he falls over backwards, onto his backside, to evade it. The umpires are checking for something... Having a word with Morgan, checking if he's okay, basically. It grazed his helmet as it went through, and Morgan took his eye off the ball
4192,2ndInnings$Only three back - third man, fine leg, deep backward square leg. Slip has gone away now to short extra-cover

4192,2ndInnings$deGrandhomme to Stokes, FOUR runs, down the track again, and though he doesn't get close to the pitch of the ball, this time it's short enough for him to whip it away through square leg, with a strong swivel at the hips

Wide length ball, carved away in the air, and Lockie sprints in from the boundary, throws himself forward, and grabs it two-handed, perfectly clean, a couple of inches off the ground. The soft signal was out, but the soft signal doesn't matter at all, because the replays were so conclusive. We've seen some outstanding catches at this World Cup. This is among the top three.

4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, no run, length ball slanting across towards off stump, gets half-forward to block down the pitch
4192,2ndInnings$The required rate now is exactly a run a ball: 147 off 147.
4192,2ndInnings$25.5
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, 1 run, down the track and Neesham bowls a back-of-a-length ball slanting across Stokes, who punches crisply to deep point
4192,2ndInnings$25.6
4192,2ndInnings$2
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Buttler, 2 runs, length ball outside off, nice stride forward for the checked drive to the right of deep point

4192,2ndInnings$deGrandhomme to Stokes, no run, length ball angling into middle stump. Stokes plays the checked drive to mid-on, and it hangs in the air briefly. The ball's stopping a lot now

4192,2ndInnings$26.6
4192,2ndInnings$0
4192,2ndInnings$deGrandhomme to Stokes, no run, extra bounce, and was there an edge? No idea, but Latham puts it down, standing up to the stumps. Length ball outside off, and the bounce sneaks it past - or grazes - Stokes' outside edge as he looks to push into the covers with an angled bat. We'll need to see replays
4192,2ndInnings$27.1

4192,2ndInnings$0
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, no run, back of a length outside off, this ball on this pitch comes on to the bat too slow for Stokes to slap it through point, ends up hitting it to cover instead
4192,2ndInnings$27.3
4192,2ndInnings$4
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, FOUR runs, down the track and that's serious power. Gets fairly close to the pitch of one angling away from him, and the angle allows him to free his arms. Flat-bats it hard past the bowler's right hand, making umpire Dharmasena take cover
4192,2ndInnings$27.4
4192,2ndInnings$1w
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, 1 wide, shortish, down the leg side, can't connect with the flick off the hip

4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, 1 run, down the track again and Neesham shortens his length, bowls it at Stokes' body. Pulled off the hip to deep square leg
4192,2ndInnings$27.5
4192,2ndInnings$0
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Buttler, no run, slower length ball outside off, Buttler gets a nice stride forward to drive, and short extra-cover dives left to stop it
4192,2ndInnings$27.6
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Buttler, 1 run, back of a length, legcutter in the fifth-stump channel. Punched to deep point
4192,2ndInnings$28.1
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$deGrandhomme to Buttler, 1 run, back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the push into the covers and it holds up on the surface and rolls through square leg off the inside edge
4192,2ndInnings$Balashankar: "What a spell it has been today by CdG. His bowling resembles a lot that of Mohinder Amarnath. This spell could well be on the same lines as the one Amarnath bowled in the 1983 final." -- CdG is a lot quicker than Amarnath. Or even the classic New Zealand dibbly-dobblers he gets compared to. CdG is not a Gavin Larsen or Chris Harris. He's more like Dion Nash, a genuine new-ball bowler if there's swing.

4192,2ndInnings$2b
4192,2ndInnings$deGrandhomme to Buttler, 2 byes, ooh, what a delivery. Length ball, pitching outside off and nipping in like an offbreak. Comes forward to drive through the covers, leaves a gap between bat and pad, and it sneaks through and doesn't miss off stump by much. Ricochets off Latham's glove into the fine leg region
4192,2ndInnings$Tasmeem: "Woakes can bat, so do Plunkett and Rashid. But this may be the last grasp of hope for the English with Mark Wood being a walking wicket." -- Archer can bat too.

4192,2ndInnings$Santner to Stokes, no run, flat, angling away from off stump, and it goes on with the arm after pitching. Looks to cut, can't connect, may have been playing for turn
4192,2ndInnings$Kamran Yousaf : "This Buttler-Stokes partnership will be similar to Lamb-Fairbrother in 1992. Back then Imran Khan brought back Wasim Akram to break the partnership and in this match Boult will be the man!!!"
4192,2ndInnings$Adwaita Govind : "Excellent tactics from Williamson. He has held santner back. Eng would have thought of targeting him with short square boundary. Now they have lost too many waiting for him. They have to attack santner and perish. Unless they play like Jadeja"

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Buttler, FOUR runs, ooh, in the air, but in the gap too. Short, not a whole lot of width, but Buttler gets off his feet, rides the bounce, and carves it away to the right of backward point. Guptill's the fielder there, though, and his athletic dive and one-handed stretch make it look like a chance when it probably wasn't

4192,2ndInnings$Henry to Buttler, no run, Buttler plays around his front pad, trying it work it over the leg side, and falls over. Umpire Dharmasena shakes his head. Not given out lbw. Williamson challenges the on-field not-out decision. This seems to be heading down leg, though. Nicely pitched up, veers back in to ping the front pad below the knee-roll in line with middle and leg. Yup, that's missing leg stump and Dharmasena (finally) gets it right

4192,2ndInnings$2
4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Plunkett, 2 runs, full-toss on leg stump, Plunkett pumps it in the air, but it does not carry to Santner at long-on. He tears across to his left and collects the ball
4192,2ndInnings$47.6
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Plunkett, 1 run, middle-stump yorker from Boult, squeezed down to long-on. Santner in the thick of the action once again. He hunts down the ball and keeps it to one
4192,2ndInnings$48.1
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Plunkett, 1 run, slower legcutter, finishes on leg stump, hauled away to the left of deep midwicket. Nicholls moves swiftly to his left and gathers the ball in the outfield
4192,2ndInnings$England need 24 from 12. Plunkett on strike. Williamson #Unleash(es)theNeesh. Try to breathe if you can...

4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, 1 run, inch-perfect leg-stump yorker, floors Stokes, clipped to deep square leg. Neesham gets Stokes off the strike

4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Plunkett, OUT, Legcutter from Neesham, 114ks, Plunkett aims to launch it over long-off. Nope, he can't clear Boult at the boundary. This was full and outside off, Plunkett got underneath it and swung it in the air... but was done in by the lack of pace
4192,2ndInnings$LE Plunkett c Boult b Neesham 10 (13m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00
4192,2ndInnings$48.4
4192,2ndInnings$6
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, SIX runs, Is that six? Yes it is! Crazy scenes at Lord's. Boult nearly pulls off a hokey-pokey catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary. He catches the ball near the boundary, but well the momentum takes his over the ad boards. His foot is on the ad board as he relays the ball to Guptill. Fine margins. It could have been a match-winning catch. Instead, it's a six. Stokes manufactures some swinging room, full on the stumps, Stokes belts it in the air...
4192,2ndInnings$England need 22 off nine balls. Here comes Jofra Archer
4192,2ndInnings$48.5
4192,2ndInnings$1
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Stokes, 1 run, back of a length on middle stump, punched down to long-on. Just a single for Stokes
4192,2ndInnings$48.6
4192,2ndInnings$W
4192,2ndInnings$Neesham to Archer, OUT, Archer bags a first-ball duck in the final. Pressure can make you do strange things. Another legcutter variation, full on middle, Archer does not spot it. He swings for the hills, deflects this slower ball off the pad onto the stumps
4192,2ndInnings$JC Archer b Neesham 0 (5m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
4192,2ndInnings$49.1

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, no run, yorker just outside off, jabbed to the left of extra-cover. Stokes keeps the strike as Williamson swoops down on the ball
4192,2ndInnings$Right, it's down to England needing 15 off the last over

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, no run, mighty full and outside off, not quite a perfect yorker, jabbed more or less straight to Williamson at extra-cover
4192,2ndInnings$49.3
4192,2ndInnings$6
4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, SIX runs, Whacked over midwicket. Lord's raises itself to a massive roar. Boult ditches the yorker. Slower ball, full and outside off, in the slot. Stokes drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over midwicket
4192,2ndInnings$49.4
4192,2ndInnings$6
4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, 6 runs, It's all happening at Lord's. Full-toss on middle, smeared away to deep midwicket. Guptill attacks the ball and sets himself up for a direct hit. It might have well been a direct hit had Stokes not inadvertently deflected it away with his outstretched bat, diving forward to save himself from being run-out. The deflection ensures the ball tickles away to the boundary. It's six runs in the end. Wouldya believe it? It's ridiculous

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, middle-stump yorker, Stokes backs away outside leg and stabs it down to long-off. Santner hunts down the ball at long-off and throws it to Boult, who takes the bails off in ice-cool fashion. Stokes had to go for the second, he had to be on strike, but Rashid is caught short by a long way. Gone for a duck without facing a ball
4192,2ndInnings$AU Rashid run out (Santner/Boult) 0 (7m 0b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
4192,2ndInnings$England need 3 off 2 balls. Williamson chats with Boult, he is slowing things down

4192,2ndInnings$Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, Holy Moly! It's a freaking tie. We're not done yet. We will have a Super Over to decide the winner of the 2019 World Cup. This is a full-toss on middle, Boult searches for the yorker, but can't get it right, hacked down to long-on. The fielder hares in, gathers the ball. Stokes tears back for the second, Wood dishes out a desperate full-length dive, but the throw is to the bowler's end and Wood is caught metres short
4192,2ndInnings$MA Wood run out (Neesham/Boult) 0 (3m 0b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
4192,2ndInnings$Okay, it's down to 2 off 1 ball. Breathe

4192,2ndInnings$7.07pm Thanks, Deiva. So... the Super Over. England will bat first. The teams have only two wickets each. And what happens if we get another tie now? the team that has hit more boundaries in their innings and the Super Over will win.
4192,2ndInnings$Who will New Zealand nominate as their bowler? Boult? Right after he's finished the most draining of final overs? Lockie Ferguson, with his changes of pace? The New Zealand players are gathered in a circle, and all kinds of deliberations must be going on. They look pretty calm, though.
4192,2ndInnings$England have nominated Stokes and Buttler as their two openers. It's Trent Boult to bowl. Neither of these three players deserves to be on the losing team. Neither team deserves to be the losing team. But we must have a winner. A World Cup winner. Here we go.
4192,2ndInnings$7.03pm CRAZY SCENES at Lord's. We will have a Super Over shootout to decide the winner. Karthik Krishnaswamy is back to close it out for good
