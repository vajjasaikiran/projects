4157,1stInnings$Australia's openers are out there. Aaron Finch will take strike with Warner at the other end. Amir has the new ball.
4157,1stInnings$Sid Monga: This is the ground where Mohammad Amir played his first first-class match on comeback. And he played a big part in bowling Somerset out for 128, and none other than Marcus Trescothick praised him for swinging the ball, and swinging it late. Pakistan will want much of that in a few minutes' time.
4157,1stInnings$Both teams are out there for the anthems.
4157,1stInnings$Baskar: "Finally, we might see Smith rolling his arm today after a long time. Interestingly today, both the teams depend on an all-rounder who rarely complete their bowling quota." Will be interesting. He did a bit of bowling in the warm-up games. He didn't bowl a lot when he was captain.
4157,1stInnings$Marshall Raja: "Aus and swinging ball. There could be only one winner. Why do they always get to bat in overcast conditions."

Warner is a different story; his lower SR in this WC is perhaps due to bowlers(right arm) ensuring they dont give him a lot of room by bowling tighter lines while running in over the wicket. Remains to be seen if Hasan Ali follows a similar approach. "

4157,1stInnings$Hasan Ali to Cummins, OUT, caught behind! 134kph but this rears off a length and catches the gloves on the way through to the keeper! Good short ball, Cummins was surprised, tried to lean back and cut but the bounce and pace was too much, it comes off the gloves and an easy catch for the skipper

4157,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Carey, OUT, LBW! Superb yorker! Carey reviews. It was full and tailed into the front shoe, he got it out of the way but it hit the back pad infront of leg. No bat involved by the looks. Nothing on ultra edge. Ball tracking says ... OUT. Pitched in line, hitting in line, smashing leg stump! Good decision. Even better bowling.

4157,1stInnings$W
4157,1stInnings$Mohammad Amir to Starc, OUT, caught at long on! Five for Amir! He deserved that. he has single handedly dragged Pakistan back. This was full in the slot, but slightly off speed, he drives in the air flat down the ground but not long enough anf Shoaib takes the running catch

4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 no ball, tight line and length, on the back foot, but an over-step! It's a free hit coming up! In fact, it shouldn't have been called, but too late now...
4157,2ndInnings$2.32pm Here come the players. Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq to lead the line in what is ostensibly a daunting target, but is little more than a run-a-ball ... and in this day and age, it's not out of the question, especially for a side that was scoring 340-plus for fun against England recently... (okay, and losing...)
4157,2ndInnings$2.27pm Hello again... well, we've got a contest here, in spite of everything. When Aaron Finch and David Warner were in harness, there were visions of 400 flitting through the Australian dressing-room. Instead they've scraped past 300 after a stunning spell from Mohammad Amir. But anything he can do, Mitchell Starc can surely match it ... don't stray far! The chase will be underway any minute now ...
4157,2ndInnings$Mike Hussey, our Match Day studio analyst, reckons Warner's innings was liking watching the batsman of old ...
4157,2ndInnings$Rahul Pagaria: "For almost two decades, the cricketing world has been praising the fighting spirits of other teams or players against Australia, while Australia winning with comfortable margins. I reckon today will be the same day with all praises for Amir, but still, Aussies winning in the end."

4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, good wheels! Zipping through a wild pull, no contact whatsoever. Justice is done in the end

4157,2ndInnings$1
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run, poor ball, on the toes, clipped behind square but well enough gathered on the bounce by the sweeper
4157,2ndInnings$Wajid Jawaid: "I think Pakistan will start this innings in a positive frame of mind. They have the momentum of the end of their bowling innings with them. But they need one of their top three to make a big score, preferably a three figure one"
4157,2ndInnings$0.5
4157,2ndInnings$0
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Fakhar Zaman, no run, back of a length, off-stump line, tough to take on that sort of ball so Fakhar shoulders arms and accepts it as a sighter

4157,2ndInnings$0
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Fakhar Zaman, no run, sizzler! Pitches on the left-hander's off stump, goes with the angle, climbs past the outside edge as Fakhar holds his line

4157,2ndInnings$0
4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, stands tall on the back foot, solid defence back down the track, half a thought of a single but Starc swoops quickly to send Fakhar scurrying for his crease

4157,2ndInnings$0
4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, huge appeal! Starc goes half a yard fuller, and suddenly that jag off the seam is right up to the edge of the bat. Did it graze through to the keeper? The Aussies decline the review
4157,2ndInnings$2.1
4157,2ndInnings$W
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, back of a length, the first hint of width of the innings, so Fakhar climbs into the cut with hard hands, Richardson at third man is expertly positioned and gobbles the flying edge. That was a sucker punch, and Pakistan's hopes of a composed start are already looking wobbly

4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Babar Azam, no run, full length, blocked on the back foot in front of all three stumps. Solidity is the order of the day
4157,2ndInnings$Naveed: "And here we go again.. the other Pakistan is back on.. difficult being a Pakistani supporter.. they are like Auckland weather, terrible and absolute gem in a matter of minutes" An improvement on Bristol weather then?
4157,2ndInnings$2.5
4157,2ndInnings$4
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, stand and deliver! Babar waits for the over-pitch outside off. No footwork, but none needed! Just launching the hands through the arc and away to the point boundary!

4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, short, and clattered! Imam takes no prisoners with that pull! A decent bouncer, well directed, but he's right on top of the stroke, rifling it through square leg!
4157,2ndInnings$Ali: "All this opening pair needed to do was take it easy. Even if Pak is 30/0 after 10 overs, that would have been fine. Wickets is key for this batting line up in a chase. "

4157,2ndInnings$4
4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, that is liquid cricket! Oozing through the covers with a sumptuous high elbow! Just a touch over-pitched and punished with alacrity!

4157,2ndInnings$Cummins to Babar Azam, no run, half-forward and defended again. Babar is staying very neutral in his footwork, refusing to commit forward or back

4157,2ndInnings$5.3
4157,2ndInnings$4
4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, short, slashed, clear of the slips! Short again from Starc, but on a wider line. Imam's reflexive pull takes a fat toe-end and soars over the cordon!
4157,2ndInnings$5.4
4157,2ndInnings$4
4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, too full, too obvious! Imam knew it was coming, the attempted yorker, but with no swing, it was a simple flick through the leg-side from a well-set, well-balanced batsman!
4157,2ndInnings$5.5
4157,2ndInnings$0
4157,2ndInnings$Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, outside off, back of a length, and a cautious, judicious leave. No need to chase those!
