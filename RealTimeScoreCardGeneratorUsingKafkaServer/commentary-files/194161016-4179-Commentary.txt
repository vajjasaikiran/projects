4179,1stInnings$0.1
4179,1stInnings$1w
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, 1 wide, sharp pace, but swinging down the leg side. England are off the mark as Roy attempts a flick but can't time it
4179,1stInnings$0.1
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, 141kph, shaping into the right-hander, but on a leg-stump line once more, and Roy tucks a clip to short midwicket
4179,1stInnings$0.2
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, FOUR runs, shorter, wider, chopped fiercely past point! That's how Roy likes to roll, emphatic forearms, powered through the ball, and the fielder has no chance!
4179,1stInnings$0.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, squared up a touch on a leg-stump line once more, angling in from middle-and-leg, and Roy topples forward in an emphatic block
4179,1stInnings$0.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, jeepers, that's a tight leave! Bending inexorably towards the top of off, Roy holds his bat inside the line and it was length more than anything that was the deciding factor
4179,1stInnings$0.5
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, FOUR runs, solid and emphatic once more! It's been a fine over, but it's cost nine already, as Roy leans on a fuller length, full face through the line, and whistling through the covers.
4179,1stInnings$0.6
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, so close! Was Roy tempted by the gap at second slip? An open-faced steer, or an attempt at least ... but he just avoids snicking through to the keeper
4179,1stInnings$The second slip is gone already to reinforce the covers...
4179,1stInnings$1.1
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, shuffling to the crease, with that dramatic javelin jab of the arm, and swinging into a front-foot block
4179,1stInnings$Bum-rah!

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, nibble, nibble! Bairstow is lured forward by the wide approach on the crease, playing for the one angled in, but beaten by one that nips away!

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, solidly forward, head over the ball, and blocked urgently to cover

4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, this is a fine over from Bumrah, tight and threatening with every ball on a full length, angled in. Blocked
4179,1stInnings$1.6
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, 1 run, fenced down to third man off a controlled outside edge. They jog the single to spoil the maiden over. But it's been a lively start at both ends of the pitch
4179,1stInnings$Vinod Rajpal: "The Indian away kits are a bit confusing ; Looks like half of the players are dressed completely differently ! 4/10 !!" If in doubt, they are the ones not in light blue

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, no run, struck dead in front of the stumps, but a big inside edge! Crikey, that would have been stone-dead, but Shami knew

4179,1stInnings$Usman: "Roy's return has made a huge difference to this English side. Looks confident and fearless all of a sudden." Early days, but yes, there's a purpose to his batting that James Vince, bless him, could not replicate
4179,1stInnings$2.2
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, FOUR runs, slashed, inside edge, four runs! Bairstow living dangerously, flinging his bottom hand through the line and so nearly taking his off stump with it! But there's no-one to cut it off at fine leg
4179,1stInnings$2.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, no run, fenced firmly into the covers

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, no run, flogged firmly into the covers! Half-stopped as mid-off ran round to intercept
4179,1stInnings$Hiren Patel: "Winner will be lifting icc Cricket World Cup 2019 .. Sixth sense output " England will accept 50-50 odds at this stage of their faltering campaign!
4179,1stInnings$2.6
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, no run, this one scuttles! Intriguing signs, as the ball keeps low outside off and Bairstow is flat-footed on a wafty drive
4179,1stInnings$3.1
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Roy, 1 run, poked firmly into the gap in the covers, Roy takes his chance to play Bumrah from the other end ...

4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, wider on the crease and fires in the yorker! But Bairstow is equal to it, punching it with bottom hand up to mid-off
4179,1stInnings$Sanjay: "Have been following this lovely game for last 40 yrs and haven't seen a team more professional than this Indian team. All catches are caught, everyone is agile on the field, everyone throws at the wicketkeeper, bowlers are given bowls at the top of runup, hardly any misfields, no sledging. They come, play, win, leave. " We might as well pack up and go then!
4179,1stInnings$3.5
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, FOUR runs, slightly mis-directed this time, on the pads, and Bairstow needs no second invitation, clipping with the angle towards the short boundary. Pant made good ground but the ball dribbled out of his reach
4179,1stInnings$Hiren Patel.... Though that prediction could have been true at the start of the tournament, it is no more now, with Australia improving each match and looking like the invincible team in the WC for which they are know..." Yeah, I was at Lord's yesterday, and Australia are a UNIT...

4179,1stInnings$4.2
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, 2 runs, clipped off the toes once more, as England keep the runs ticking in the face of a threatening new-ball burst
4179,1stInnings$4.3
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, FOUR runs, another slashed inside-edge! Bairstow has got that shot down to a tee! Once again, a cramped drive, with the bottom elbow losing shape on impact, and the stumps nearly wearing the deflection!
4179,1stInnings$4.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, no run, more robust in defence this time, leaning forward to block into the covers

4179,1stInnings$4.6
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, 2 runs, hard-handed once again from Bairstow! He's by a distance the least settled of England's openers, but he's finding a way nonetheless. A thick outside-edge this time as third man sweeps around
4179,1stInnings$Abhijato: "Jonny Barstow is French will be cutting his way to a half-century today, Mr Miller. Mark the words which might come out of his pocket: 'Yay Media Talk Nah'!" He is never more dangerous than when he perceives a slight, real or otherwise!

4179,1stInnings$5.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, beaten by a big turner outside off! Off come the bails, to lots of excitement but his back foot is well anchored

4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Roy, 1 run, extra nip on the back foot! Roy wears this on the glove, but Bairstow is alert, stealing the single to point as the fielder swoops in
4179,1stInnings$6.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, no run, sliding into the legs, a slightly wafty one-handed wallop across the line as Bairstow fails to line up a pull

4179,1stInnings$Bumrah to Bairstow, 1 run, width from Bumrah, Bairstow meets it at the top of the bounce with a cross-batted chop into the gap at point. Another useful single to the cause

4179,1stInnings$7.6
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, FOUR runs, contemptuous! Slower through the air from Chahal, a long way outside off too. But Roy read it from the hand, waited on one knee, and pounded it with glee through midwicket! This is a very promising sign for England...

4179,1stInnings$6

4179,1stInnings$11.1
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run, pushed with an open stance into the covers
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to continue, with extra protection on the boundary now that the Powerplay is over

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, no run, Roy rocks back, climbing into a cut, but point is well placed to cut it off
4179,1stInnings$11.3
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, 1 run, a bottom-handed flog, along the ground to long-off
4179,1stInnings$11.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, on the back foot, meeting the legbreak with a tentative closed-batted dab
4179,1stInnings$11.5
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, drift and spin, and Bairstow is beaten! Caught in two minds on the back foot ... misses the edge and the stumps by a whisker!
4179,1stInnings$11.6
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run, absolutely pounded, and so close to holing out to Bumrah! Any more elevation and it would have been straight down his throat at deep midwicket. Instead it skipped one bounce off the turf, thudding into his upturned palms
4179,1stInnings$12.1
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, FOUR runs, a round-house pull through the leg side, timing and placement as England keep the runs pumping

4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, FOUR runs, that is majestic! Planting the front foot, flinging the hands through the line, and dumping the ball with the straightest of swings for a one-bounce four over long-on!
4179,1stInnings$12.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, no run, banged into the pitch, down the leg side, a slight deflection prevents the wide
4179,1stInnings$12.4

4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, 1 leg bye, slower ball, ghosting into the pads as Bairstow tucks a shot to midwicket

4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 1 run, angled into the pads, clipped with poise through square leg

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, no run, angling forward, closing the face on impact, another good over, so no need to up the ante at the end of it
4179,1stInnings$Kiran: "Dhoni was so reliable with the review system that almost every single time he called them rightly however, he has failed against India vs Pakistan and again today. So reminds us that he's a human after all.. Dhoni Review System failing!!"
4179,1stInnings$13.1
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, FOUR runs, reverse sweep! Pinged through backward point to put the pressure on Chahal right from the start of the over ...
4179,1stInnings$On that shot to midwicket from Bairstow just now, Nagraj points out: "Bumrah cannot dive, mind you, due to his injury in the first match of the IPL - some side strain after he landed a(wk)wardly. Not that anybody would have snatched that Roy catch off the last ball of Pandy over"

4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, 1 run, crashed out to short cover! Excitement for the crowd, but that was a bump ball
4179,1stInnings$13.3
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, SIX runs, formidable and punishing! Bairstow seizes on the length, pirouetting through his bended knee and battering a slog sweep high over cow corner!
4179,1stInnings$13.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, leans back for a fierce cut into the covers. Intercepted again, but every shot right now is a furious one ...

4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, googly into the pads, Bairstow can't fence it away as it deflects to the leg side

4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, head over the ball, solid block to dot up another run-laden over

4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, no run, a cautiously blocked sighter off the back foot, making space on the leg side, but exercising caution

4179,1stInnings$14.2
4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, FOUR runs, that is a stunning straight blow! One sighter is ample as Roy saunters to the pitch of the ball and lambasts a flat drive over the bowler's head!
4179,1stInnings$14.3
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, dancing at the crease again, cut hard into the covers

4179,1stInnings$4
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs, full toss, and crashed with stiff forearms over wide long-on! Pick your spot, and cash in!
4179,1stInnings$14.5
4179,1stInnings$3
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, 3 runs, a delicate dab, down on one knee, deflected so fine for a long chase through backward square. A good slide cuts off the boundary
4179,1stInnings$14.6
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, eased with lots of bottom hand to mid-on

4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, 1 run, opens the face, and guides a checked drive into space in the covers. Gasps from the crowd, but fell well short ...

4179,1stInnings$15.2
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, leaning back for an ungainly wipe, misses out
4179,1stInnings$15.3
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, SIX runs, there's a man back on the rope, but Bairstow has got too much on this one! Spring-loaded forearms once again, picking the ball up from a full, leg-stump line, and KL Rahul flings himself backward at long-on to no avail!
4179,1stInnings$15.4
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run, eased into the leg side for a measured single
4179,1stInnings$15.5
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Roy, 1 run, wide line, cracked with power into the covers, as Roy bends his knee into a stretched smear-drive
4179,1stInnings$15.6
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, SIX runs, launched once again! England are now officially on the rampage! Another ball in the slot, another contemptuous club over long on! The ante has been upped, the game has been raised ... the World Cup survival fight is ON!
4179,1stInnings$Satheesh Vaidhy: "Wounded England have been woken up. It looks like India is trying hard to eliminate Pakistan by losing today" Not sure that's their primary concern. Clearing out England before the semis would be a massive opportunity...
4179,1stInnings$16.1
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, fuller one driven straight past the bowler
4179,1stInnings$Nitin Sharma: "Kohli shouldn't have removed Shami. He was almost about to get Bairstow's wicket. There is still merit in bringing him back. He should think wickets not runs" - on a flat pitch, given this England batting line-up, you have to think of both.
4179,1stInnings$Roshy: "One thing Ind and Aus haven't done quite often and successfully in this WC is chasing big totals and this might be the last chance for Ind!!" - certainly looks like they'll have the chance to do that!
4179,1stInnings$Time for Miller to take a breather. This England assault will leave most breathless to be honest. And Forecaster has zoomed to 356.

4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run, eased down to long-on from a full length on leg stump
4179,1stInnings$KL Rahul is off the field meanwhile and Jadeja is on for him. That fall seemed to hurt him
4179,1stInnings$16.3
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 2 runs, crashed through the offside again, but didn't have the timing on it, so long-off is able to run to his left and clean up
4179,1stInnings$16.4
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 2 runs, clipped comfortably off his pads to long-on to raise a fine fifty on comeback. What a difference Jason Roy has made today
4179,1stInnings$16.5
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, SIX runs, that is just thumped. THUMPED. Dances down the track, gets to the pitch and lifts this over the sight screen. Shredded
4179,1stInnings$16.6
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, no run, down the track again, but Kuldeep has managed to get this to dip a bit so Roy ends up defending it back with a straight bat
4179,1stInnings$17.1
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, stayed in his crease to guide this fine, but not fine enough so short third man fields it

4179,1stInnings$17.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, some drift in that and Bairstow unable to whip this off his pads. Three dots in a row!
4179,1stInnings$17.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, googly, and he's not read it at all, goes back to slash it but it goes flat and spins back in to hit him on the pads. Easily going down leg, despite the excitable (and understandable) appeal
4179,1stInnings$17.5
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, no run, fuller this time, driven firmly to cover
4179,1stInnings$17.6
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Chahal to Bairstow, SIX runs, slam! five dot balls and Bairstow rocks back to smear this over wide long-on. No fielder there, and it just clears the rope. An over that was looking like it could hand back some control to India has ended up costing six runs - that's been England's batting today
4179,1stInnings$18.1
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, wanted to club that into one of the canals in Birmingham, but didn't get hold of it, one bounce to deep midwicket

4179,1stInnings$18.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, no run, slows it up, and Roy is a mite early into the drive, ends up toe-ending it back to the bowler. Bump ball, so even though Kuldeep tot into a tangle with Bairstow while going for it, wouldn't have mattered if he caught it
4179,1stInnings$18.4
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, goes back and tucks this to short fine
4179,1stInnings$18.5
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, SIX runs, that one's outta here! Slog sweep from the Steve Waugh manual, going down on one knee and well forward, read the length and the turn and just sent it over the boundary
4179,1stInnings$18.6
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, 2 runs, clipped to deep square that time for a couple
4179,1stInnings$19.1
4179,1stInnings$2
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 2 runs, down the track, giving himself room and slashes this over cover. There is protection in the deep, but it's in the gap enough to net two
4179,1stInnings$Hardik is back
4179,1stInnings$Roshy: "Seems like the 200 million Pak fans have shifted their paryers for a NZ emission, so they might be praying for Eng to win now. Only Bdesh and Sl needs Eng to lose today,after the double header from yesterday!"
4179,1stInnings$Javed Ghaffar: "Instead of keep on working with two bowlers from each end, India must keep on rotating their bowlers here. Using their part timers in the middle somewhere isn't a bad idea."

4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, no run, length outside off, Roy was a touch early into his punch. Some balls seem to hold up when pitched on a length. Goes safely though into the cover region
4179,1stInnings$19.3
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, no run, fuller, driven crisply, but straight to cover
4179,1stInnings$19.4
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, no run, ooh swing and a miss to one that kept low. Fuller length outside off, cross-seam, and Roy's big drive connects with air
4179,1stInnings$Kiran : "I really want England to score 350+ runs&see How India does .Because in 2003&2015 #worldcup , 2017 champions trophy . India failed to chase over 300 runs in semi's &Finals as well "
4179,1stInnings$19.5
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 1 run, gets hold of that one, back of a length outside off and slashed through point, but there is a man in the deep
4179,1stInnings$19.6
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, 1 run, slower ball fools Bairstow! But his checked off-drive falls safely. That spooned up in the air over mid-off, but well short of long-off
4179,1stInnings$20.1
4179,1stInnings$6
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, SIX runs, clears long-on again! The luck is firmly with Bairstow in this game. Down the track, didn't get hold of it exactly, but got enough meat to go over long-on

4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run, good length on off, spinning into him, stands tall and punch to long-on
4179,1stInnings$20.4
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, 1 run, he's still tossing it up, and Roy clears his front leg out to smear this with power straight down the ground. Not off the middle of the bat though, so long-off has time to come around
4179,1stInnings$20.5
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, no run, inside edged onto boot. Minor victory for the bowler. Went for a booming drive that rolled off inside edge and boot into the offside. For a moment, Bairstow thought that might have gone on the stumps, but the inside edge has been his friend today too
4179,1stInnings$20.6
4179,1stInnings$0
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Bairstow, no run, googly, plays it off the back foot, read it off the pitch and jabbed it towards gully

4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, no run, swing and a miss! Slower ball, on a length outside off and keeps low again

4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 1 run, digs it in short - they've not really explored that option, India's quicks, today - but Roy is equal to it, pulls it powerfully to deep square
4179,1stInnings$Shiva, our stats maven, has this on Hardik: In his ODI career, Pandya has gone for 6.43 an over and has averaged 76.38 in his first spells when the opposition has lost fewer than a couple of wickets. Nearly double of what he's averaged when India have had the opposition two or more down when he's come on to bowl.
4179,1stInnings$21.3
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, 1 run, length ball, nipping into him a bit, uses the angle to turn it to deep square
4179,1stInnings$21.4
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 1 run, slower bouncer outside off, waits for it and doesn't go too hard on the pull, keeps it down to deep square
4179,1stInnings$21.5
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Bairstow, 1 run, slower ball off-cutter again, coming into his pads, stabbed past mid-on. Hung in the air for a bit, but safe
4179,1stInnings$21.6
4179,1stInnings$1
4179,1stInnings$Pandya to Roy, 1 run, fuller on off stump, clipped to mid-off and they get a quick single. Direct hit from Chahal there but the batsman was in
4179,1stInnings$22.1
4179,1stInnings$W
4179,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Roy, OUT, Jadeja pulls off a blinder at long-on Roy is in disbelief, but he'll have to go I think. This was a bit of a top-spinner, Roy got to the pitch to cart it down the ground but didn't get the elevation. It still looked like a one bounce four until Jadeja came sprinting to his left, dived full length and plucked the ball inches from the ground. He's a wonder in the field is Jadeja, and it's needed that moment of outlandish brilliance to break this opening stand.

4179,1stInnings$Nitin: "Although it's easy to say now after butchering spinners getting yet this team selection is sketchy. Keeping two spinners with no batting prowess and leaving behind Vijay Shankar on this featureless track. Even stronger case here was for Jadeja who inexplicably hasn't got any matches yet. " - Kohli did say Vijay had a toe niggle though.
4179,1stInnings$Vishwa A: "There is a clear difference of class between Indian opener bowlers and other bowlers."

4179,1stInnings$Eric: "I am puzzled at some of the comments about how the Indian bowlers are thrashed. Sachin did mention before the match that ball will fly. Perhaps it is due to the fact that in matches so far bowlers did well on a different kind of pitch."

4179,1stInnings$Mohammed Shami to Morgan, OUT, short ball, Morgan sends a spiralling top edge on the hook - taken! Bounced out again, not a great look for the England captain, although he's a man who lives by the sword. Pushed across the batsman by Shami, got too big on him, never in control of the shot and Jadhav did really well running around from fine leg to take the catch diving forwards!

Out of the 47 instances in the last ten years when teams have been 180 or more for one or no wickets lost at the end of the 30th over, only once have oppositions managed to concede fewer runs from the next-10 overs. Against England, the lowest such ten-over score was 90/2 by Bangladesh earlier in this World Cup. India conceded just 43 today from 31 to 40."

4179,2ndInnings$2.25pm: England go brrrm brrrm in Brum, although a target of 338 is probably 30 runs shy of what India might have been facing had they not bowled so well in the 31-40 overs period. The openers tore it up, with Jonny Bairstow raising a defiant maiden World Cup hundred, only for India to hit back in the latter stages of the innings - Jasprit Bumrah was the good cop giving nothing away, while Mohammed Shami applied a shakedown at the other end, despite ending with the bruises to show for it. Had it not been for Ben Stokes providing the late humpty and hustle, England's total might have looked under par; whichever way you cut it, this will require India to pull off their highest World Cup chase. Anyway, time for Match Day crew to analyse things; Saurabh will be back to kick off the India innings shortly

4179,2ndInnings$Archer to Sharma, no run, ah, he's hit that spot outside off on a length from which balls die. Gets it to nip in and Rohit has to get his bat down in a hurry to ensure it doesn't hit pad first

4179,2ndInnings$Archer to Kohli, FOUR runs, creamed - Kohli's saying he's not going to give this over to Archer entirely. Leans into the cover drive and sends it Rolls Royce like to the cover boundary. Unfazed by the last two balls

4179,2ndInnings$Woakes is operating with a deep silly mid-off. Or a very short mid-off, however you describe it. Perhaps that fielder made Kohli go across and clip

4179,2ndInnings$15.6
4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Kohli, no run, another length ball dying on Kohli he ends up defending it. Swishes angrily at the air after that

4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Sharma, 1 run, nicely stroked past a diving backward point, to his right. Raises the fifty-run stand, but it's come at a fairly plodding rate

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Kohli, FOUR runs, sumptuous once again by Kohli. Didn't have to move his feet, but his balance was perfect, and he unleashes another drive through cover, bisecting the in-field and placing it well enough so that the man at sweeper cover can't get to it
4179,2ndInnings$16.3

4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Sharma, no run, too close to cut and too quick too perhaps at 147 kph. Rohit doesn't connect
4179,2ndInnings$Mustafa Moudi: "This chase seems to be on line with NZ's chase yeasterday... they are wasting too many balls in the name of formjng partnership and end up collapse when the Asking Rate goes up to 10n"

4179,2ndInnings$17.6
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Kohli, 2 runs, another back of length ball but this time outside off, well placed by Kohli just past the backward point fielder. Third man has to run to his right to collect

4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Rashid to Sharma, no run, tosses up a loopy, lazy legbreak outside off, patted towards point

4179,2ndInnings$Archer to Kohli, 1 run, short ball, 148kph/92mph and Kohli rides it well, cross-batted dab to third man
4179,2ndInnings$Zubair Islam: "If India is round 170 by 30 overs without further loss of (wk)t....they r in the game. Double score formula." I'm not sure they'll be quite that far on; but then teams can pretty much double their 35-over score these days

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Kohli, OUT, [rubs eyes] oh Virat... Steers a length ball to backward point! YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT! Another fifty but no cigar for Kohli, who has given England an opening just when things were beginning to get itchy! Eager to get bat on ball, maybe skidded through a touch, and Vince swallowed a fat outside edge

4179,2ndInnings$Rishabh Pant, on World Cup debut, in at No. 4. India's chances have dipped from 32% to 25%, according to Forecaster
4179,2ndInnings$28.4

4179,2ndInnings$Here's Dilip: "Eng made a smart move with inclusion of Plunkett. He did more than needed. Pricey wicket of master chase Batsman Virat back to pavilion. Victory sniffing for England." He's their middle-overs money-maker... That wicket could be the difference, though Rohit is now the danger man

4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, 1 run, fired across the bows, Pant plays it late again, slightly outside-edgey but the ball runs wide of Buttler... just one as third man comes across, to end an over of singles

4179,2ndInnings$34.2
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pant, 1 run, practically sweeps the good length ball outside off to deep square leg. Originally thinking about a pull, maybe, but then with the pace taken off again, he decides to get even lower and sweep
4179,2ndInnings$34.3
4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Sharma, no run, works the full ball on the pads to midwicket
4179,2ndInnings$34.4
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Sharma, 2 runs, another century! And it comes off a neat little chop behind point. There's really not enough room for the full blooded shot. So he checks himself. Which he's done all innings considering this is a two-paced pitch. Good gritty innings from India's outstanding opener.
4179,2ndInnings$34.5
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Sharma, 1 run, short and outside off, slashes it over to deep third man

4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, no run, the bat's gone flying to the keeper! He was looking to swat this over deep square, but doesn't connect, because the bat's flown out of his hand and over his head. Landed in front of Buttler

4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, FOUR runs, nails it this time! Short ball and he picks out the short boundary at square leg, pulls with power and precision
4179,2ndInnings$35.4
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, 1 run, rinse, repeat - but there is a fielder square now, so he gets only a single

4179,2ndInnings$35.5
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Sharma, 1 run, swipes a full toss down to square leg, tried to hit it too hard and ended up not timing it. Once bounce to the fielder
4179,2ndInnings$35.6
4179,2ndInnings$4
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, FOUR runs, clears mid-off. He wasn't intending to go there, this is a pull shot over extra cover that goes for four. Was late on it, bounces up till his shoulder but he swipes it so hard that even with that kind of contact, he's standing almost parallel to the batsman - it carries over the in-field
4179,2ndInnings$36.1
4179,2ndInnings$W
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Sharma, OUT, he's taken the big one first ball back What a return! Slower ball, off-cutter that he rolled fingers over. Rohit wanted to send it over cow corner, ends up edging behind.

4179,2ndInnings$Colm: "Lots of Indian messages taking their chances up, but run rate over 10 an over, and this match is starting to get away from them. What's the predictor for an England win now?" - it's at 26.55. Not impossible.

4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 3 runs, cracked through the offside first ball. Short and outside off, he plays a horizontal bat slap through cover. Bairstow does excellently to tumble, slide and save the boundary, thrown in with some fancy footwork too
4179,2ndInnings$and expectedly, it's Hardik Pandya coming out. Ahead of Dhoni and Jadhav. Required rate is 10.12. Win probability down to 19.27
4179,2ndInnings$36.3
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pant, 1 run, reverse sweep, top edge, and safe! everything happened in that ball. Chuck those self-help books and watch Pant for insouciant confidence. Tries a reverse sweep off a length ball, it takes the top edge, bashes into his body and lobs up near point. Three fielders, including keeper and bowler, converging. But safe

4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 2 runs, fuller outside off, and superb timing on that, just stroked through extra cover. Some running for the man in the deep to do

4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, no run, swing and a miss - there's going to be one an over with Pant. Length ball angling across, targetting cow corner, connects with air

4179,2ndInnings$37.3
4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pandya, no run, big shout for lbw but they won't review. Wood was interested, but I think too high. Comes in with the angle and catches Pandya on the crease, hits his pad flap. Morgan consults Buttler who advises against the review
4179,2ndInnings$three men on the leg side boundary for Pandya
4179,2ndInnings$37.4

4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, no run, length all on leg stump, and Pant was walking across to cart this over square leg. Doesn't connect, and wears it on the thigh pad
4179,2ndInnings$37.6
4179,2ndInnings$4
4179,2ndInnings$Wood to Pant, FOUR runs, smack that goes... over wide mid-on. Too full and a full extension of the arms to send this to the wide long-on boundary
4179,2ndInnings$38.1
4179,2ndInnings$0
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, no run, length ball wide of off, but Pandya has moved across and smeared this with power - straight to extra cover though

4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, stunning. He was moving across, Woakes tried for the leg-stump yorker, doesn't quite pull it off, Pandya goes very deep and unleashes a full-blooded on-drive, holds his shape beautifully and it goes over mid-on
4179,2ndInnings$38.3
4179,2ndInnings$4
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, and that's the bottom hand power of Pandya on show. Not that short but he goes deeper and slaps this through extra cover. No chance for the fielder who is very square
4179,2ndInnings$38.4
4179,2ndInnings$4
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, outrageous! There are two fielders on the legside in the V - long-on and deep midwicket. And he's bisected them. Too full from Woakes and with Hardik going so deep in his crease he can lift this off a half-volley and into the gap
4179,2ndInnings$38.5
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 2 runs, walks further across and twirls this to deep square, but splendid work by the man who's quite wide and dives to save the boundary
4179,2ndInnings$change in field from three men on the leg side to two, and two on off
4179,2ndInnings$38.6
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 2 runs, bullet straight drive but Root sprints very fast from long-on to slide and save
4179,2ndInnings$Long discussions between Woakes and Morgan. They're continuing. Now Woakes is tying his shoelaces. Tighter grip on his legs to stop from slipping? Pandya's hitting can sometimes do strange things...
4179,2ndInnings$Raza : "Come on Pandya. Do what you wanted to do against pakistan in champions trophy final in 17. There is no Jadeja either here. A Pakistani fan "

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pant, OUT, stunning take by Woakes! He's been carted for runs in the past over, but he pulls off a ripper on the square leg boundary, running and diving to his left, perfectly timed to snatch the ball inches from the turf. Pant was looking for his favourite walk-across-hoick to square leg and seemed to have nailed it. Until Woakes flew past.
4179,2ndInnings$RR Pant c Woakes b Plunkett 32 (58m 29b 4x4 0x6) SR: 110.34
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes gave up 16 runs in that last over. More than he had in six overs till then.

4179,2ndInnings$Alan is off comms but has his eagle-eyed observation spot on. "New boot for Woakes, rather than laces tying," he tells me. Then adds: "Possibly spring-heeled."

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pandya, 1 wide, goes for the wide one outside off and it's ruled just too wide. So he'll have to rebowl that
4179,2ndInnings$39.3
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pandya, 2 runs, poor bowling and he's punished, but Bairstow hares from deep square leg to his left and dives to save the boundary. Too short, sat up and Hardik swatted it into the legside. Outstanding work by Bairstow.
4179,2ndInnings$39.4
4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pandya, 2 runs, another short ball, this time up to the chest and Hardik places his pull shot well to get another two, between square leg and fine leg

4179,2ndInnings$2
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 2 runs, length ball outside off, he's bowling it slower - that's the pace to go, ask Pandya to generate all the power. He flat bats it through extra cover again
4179,2ndInnings$40.5
4179,2ndInnings$4
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, FOUR runs, just past Rashid at backward point. This would have been another Superman catch, he was flying to his left. Full toss outside off, and Pandya lashed this hard, gets a boundary
4179,2ndInnings$40.6
4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Pandya, 1 run, well wide of off again, but Pandya is standing across, so it's like a length ball on the fifth stump, chops it past cover

4179,2ndInnings$Rashid to Pandya, 1 run, flat and on the stumps, punched to long-on. Stokes is there so they wisely decide against the second

4179,2ndInnings$Archer to Pandya, no run, and that is another good surprise ball, bouncer into the body tucks him up, he moves across and paddles it but short fine is in place. This was also slow, 118 kph

4179,2ndInnings$1
4179,2ndInnings$Archer to Pandya, 1 run, and Archer, the man who can deliver 150kph off an ambling run-up, finishes the over with another 120 kph trundler that Pandya can only jab towards long-off

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Dhoni, FOUR runs, bang! This was at normal pace, banged in too short, Dhoni rocks back and slams it into the midwicket boundary. India will need many more of those though

4179,2ndInnings$Plunkett to Pandya, OUT, caught by Vince at long-on and that should be the game? Pandya was frustrated into mis-timing that due to England's plans against him. This was on a length and around the fifth stump, he was moving across and didn't have the room to free his arms but aimed a big swipe anyway. Takes the top edge and swirls to long-on. That popping noise you hear is the sound of several countries' hopes being burst

There are still 2 proper batsman on crease and if they can't go for victory I'm sorry, India aren't winning the WC" - Dhoni is pragmatic.

4179,2ndInnings$Woakes to Dhoni, SIX runs, smashed and India's first six of the innings comes in the last over. Normal pace, banged in short and Dhoni corks it out over deep square leg
4179,2ndInnings$Sai: "Ah ..!! Here we go again .. What if these 2 started slogging and got out ..? They would again be blamed for not batting responsibly and not saving the NRR damage .. "
4179,2ndInnings$Abhishek: "Thats 30 minutes of my life I am never getting back. This is crazy. With 5 wickets in hand and two batsmen at the crease, its difficult to digest this kind of innings. No intent at all. A 315 All out is way better than 300/5. And getting just singles isnt the best way for NRR minimization. #Pathetic"
