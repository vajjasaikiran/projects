4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Guptill, no run, huge appeal from the outset! tailing into the pads, Guptill plays across the line, and this has straightened late! India think for an eternity and review! Is it hitting in line? There's definitely no bat involved ... but it is missing leg stump! Wow...

4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Guptill, OUT, edged and gone! Bumrah's cobra-like zip off a tight off-stump line, snags the outside edge of a back-foot flinch, and that's a tremendous take from Kohli at second slip! Utterly flying, and he clings on with a shimmy to his left, high in front of his face

4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Williamson, 1 run, there he goes again with that dead-batted dab to third man. Right under the eyeline on impact, and there's very little setting a field for that
4190,1stInnings$Moe: "Since when Bumrah became sooo Good! I still remember him playing in South Africa during the test series, bowling with an a(wk)ward action thinking this guy is going to drop off once batsmen get used to that action!

4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, edged, but short of the leaping second slip! Might, in fairness, have zipped past the inside edge and come off the inner thigh, which would explain the lack of pace into the cordon. But another buzz-saw of a delivery nonetheless!

Here Kohli is trying to get through his weaker bowler who may be slightly injured while NZ are still rebuilding, rather than waiting long and reach a stage where NZ have the license to throw their bats."

4190,1stInnings$36.3
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Neesham, 1 run, on the back foot, met with a measured stab into the gap at mid-on, a sharp single to keep the score ticking
4190,1stInnings$36.4
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, no run, wider on the crease, and that's an excellent bouncer, luring Taylor into a flimsy flap off his eyebrows, can't make contact
4190,1stInnings$36.5
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, no run, full and straight, attacking the stumps, and Taylor stretches forward to defend again
4190,1stInnings$36.6
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 2 runs, a squirty leading edge, out to deep cover! The very definition of a nothing shot, except of course it brings two, a loose wipe across something resembling the line, and flying safe
4190,1stInnings$37.1
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, no run, back of a length, grips the deck as Pandya rolls his fingers, and Neesham hops as the ball skids low through to the keeper

4190,1stInnings$37.2
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, 1 run, hits the deck harder this time, Neesham is up on his toes to defend
4190,1stInnings$37.3
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Taylor, 1 run, finds the gap with a slap through the leg side, still very slim pickings for New Zealand
4190,1stInnings$37.4
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, 1 run, dropped! Rohit at midwicket, stretching backwards with one hand as Neesham was utterly suckered by another back-of-a-length cutter that sat up in the deck and took the top edge of a baffled pull
4190,1stInnings$37.5
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Taylor, no run, another quicker one, fizzing through at head height as Taylor flaps in vain
4190,1stInnings$37.6
4190,1stInnings$1w
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Taylor, 1 wide, attempted slower ball but way off target
4190,1stInnings$37.6
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Taylor, 1 run, a hint of width, cut hard through gully where the solitary wide slip makes good ground to intercept
4190,1stInnings$38.1
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 1 run, biffed off the toes, out through square leg

4190,1stInnings$38.2
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Neesham, no run, a full-blooded thump through the line of the ball, but gathered at mid-on
4190,1stInnings$Umakant Gundeli: "Thank god Rohit did not dive, he is too precious to get injured." That's one way of looking at it!
4190,1stInnings$38.3
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Neesham, 1 run, biffed with intent, up and over the leg side, not quite latching onto the drag from outside off, as the long-on sweeper gathers on the bounce
4190,1stInnings$38.4
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 2 runs, firmly belted to deep midwicket, better contact this time from Taylor, pulling hard across the line as Bhuvi drops a touch short
4190,1stInnings$38.5
4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, no run, heaving across the line! But keeping low as Taylor lined up the slower ball, lucky not to lose his off stump in the process
4190,1stInnings$38.6
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 2 runs, nurdled with good intent into the leg side, calling instantly as Taylor recognises he's hit a gap in the field
4190,1stInnings$39.1
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Neesham, 1 run, back of a length, outside off, pushed to backward point

Guptill at this stage of the innings might have been handy, even an off-colour Guptill. Everyone loves long levers in the last ten

4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, short, Taylor swings into the pull but it hurries into his shot as square leg gathers

4190,1stInnings$0
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Neesham, no run, banged in short, Neesham pulls but short midwicket is perfectly placed to intercept, not enough width across the left-hander to truly free the arms on that stroke
4190,1stInnings$39.5
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Neesham, 1 run, yorker, well dug out, instant single to short midwicket, Kohli swoops, a direct hit will be close ... it goes wide!
4190,1stInnings$39.6
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, banged in short, down the leg side, a slightly gloved pull behind square, but that's another Bumrah over chalked off
4190,1stInnings$40.1
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Taylor, 1 run, opens the face for a dab behind point, utilising the width for another single
4190,1stInnings$Ten overs to go... New Zealand will have a total on the board, but will it be a competitive one... another fielder drops out of the circle for the third Powerplay

4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, no run, short and fast, a swishing pull, but can't connect. That's through him before the stroke is formed
4190,1stInnings$Yaseen: "Kiwis are just out of bounds today. This wicket cant be so difficult that you cant work full lenght delivries for single after 40 overs." We shall see... Boult and Ferguson won't be easy on this deck. Nor Santner and deGrandhomme
4190,1stInnings$40.3
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, 1 run, well that's different! Climbs into a wild pull, misreads the slower ball, gloves a single to the off-side in the followthrough
4190,1stInnings$Forecaster says 230 after 40
4190,1stInnings$40.4
4190,1stInnings$1

4190,1stInnings$40.5
4190,1stInnings$4
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, FOUR runs, finds the gap this time! That's a valuable boundary, slightly short and Neesham was ready to cash in, targeting the backward square leg boundary, hitting with the leg-side line of the ball
4190,1stInnings$40.6
4190,1stInnings$W
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to Neesham, OUT, a massive mow, out to the leg side! Who wants this ... Karthik is the man! It's a steepling leading edge, looming out of the floodlights, but he steadies himself for a very cool take to end the stay of a dangerous customer

4190,1stInnings$Abhi: "This match resembles very much like semis between Pak vs Eng in CT 2017!!" Hmm ... New Zealand won't like that comparison!
4190,1stInnings$41.5
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Chahal to Taylor, 1 run, full once more, threatening to spin from a middle-stump line, pushed with the turn to cover

4190,1stInnings$42.2
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to deGrandhomme, 1 run, banged in short, tight line, an uncomfortable chest-high prod down to the off side

4190,1stInnings$Sarvesh Sinai: "Is 4 wickets down in 42 overs considered wickets in hand ? Should they explode or wait until 47th ?" Hard to say, a bit of both maybe? One of these guys really ought to go for it even if the other sits in
4190,1stInnings$42.5
4190,1stInnings$4
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to deGrandhomme, FOUR runs, too much width, and deflected sweetly through third man! Poor bowling with the fielder so fine, any width was meat and drink for a well-placed dab
4190,1stInnings$42.6
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Pandya to deGrandhomme, 2 runs, whipped off the toes, a very full-length lbw candidate of a delivery as CDG walked across his stumps for the flick. Nine off Pandya's last over, but he's bowled a canny spell
4190,1stInnings$43.1
4190,1stInnings$6
4190,1stInnings$Chahal to Taylor, SIX runs, there she goes! That was clean and flat, hard over cow corner! Six from the moment it was picked up from outside off, down on one knee, and Taylor's battling fifty comes up in style! His fiftieth fifty, in addition to 20 hundreds. Tidy...

4190,1stInnings$Kumar to deGrandhomme, OUT, suckered by the slower ball! Deceived through the air, his arms were already fully cocked for a massive wipe through the line, so instead he leans back for a cramped dink through third man, but merely feathers an edge to Dhoni. Poor shot, key breakthrough. He had the levers to do damage in the final five

4190,1stInnings$Somu: "Andrew.. looks like you are literally praying for new Zealand here" If you say so ... it's clearly not a deck for fluent batting .... but as mentioned earlier, an in-form Rohit tends to transcend conditions!
4190,1stInnings$Nimit: Yea as my boss says to make sick leave authentic it can not be of 2 days..It has to be of 3 days ( & with a medical certificate from doctor)..So I suggest u join office only after world cup is over..."
4190,1stInnings$5pm More bad news from Old Trafford:" And rain has picked up," says Sambit. "And that could be that." As we'd mentioned earlier the forecast isn't promising for tomorrow either.
4190,1stInnings$While it continues to rain in Manchester, why not check out all of our best content from the 2019 World Cup here
4190,1stInnings$"What about ppl like me, I called in sick today so that I could see this match... Working in IT means u can't fall sick for 2 consecutive days..." --- Good luck, Nimit
4190,1stInnings$IG: "Poor tactical execution by NZ. Knowing that india has only 5 bowlers, should have gone after atleast 1 of them if not 2. That 18 run over showed that you can go after the bowling. Now India will have a bright sunny day and a flat pitch to chase down this tiny total. Very ordinary cricket from NZ"
4190,1stInnings$TEJA: "the forecast is not good for tomorrow which means india have to play it like a t20 game right from the beginning and score as many runs as possible to stay ahead of the dls .."
4190,1stInnings$Swamy Vigyanana: "Somehow it appears that India and NZ can't see eye-to-eye this World Cup!"
4190,1stInnings$Shekhar: "Yay! So if the match doesn't happen today AND tomorrow, India goes through to the Finals by virtue of being above NZ in the group stage. AND if Finals is also washed out, then India lifts the World Cup trophy while Rain wins the World Cup." I think the trophy will be shared if the finals is washed out.
4190,1stInnings$4.45pm Looks like we have an update (kind of): We understand that if the match fails to start by 1835 local time (for a 20-over game) then it will be deferred to tomorrow. And for that to happen the rain has to ideally stop by 1730.
4190,1stInnings$"What would be the DLS target for India to win if this were to be a 20-over match now?" Pertinent question from Yogesh Deshmukh. The answer is 148
4190,1stInnings$4.42pm Prem: "Could you please get update from Sambit Bal.. and share as well" For now, we have Nagraj: "The fourth umpire is out there with his red and white umbrella, having a word with the groundsman." The wait continues...
4190,1stInnings$"If weather is nicer on the reserve day for a match, then why reduce overs on the first day? Priority to finish match on first day?" That's right, Omar. And the weather forecast for tomorrow is apparently worse
4190,1stInnings$Abhi: "If no play happens today will NZ continue from 46.2 overs?" Absolutely
4190,1stInnings$"What happens if no match is possible either today or tomorrow? Does India move to final?" Affirmative, Vikas
4190,1stInnings$4.25pm Sambit Bal is on the sun rain watch at Old Trafford:" Almost feels like sun is out even though it isn't and it has almost stopped raining... but almost is the operative word... till it has completely stopped, there can't be an inspection"
4190,1stInnings$4pm: Andrew Miller reminds me we're losing overs in 60...59...58...57 .... or not. ""The scorer here has just said that the game will start losing overs at least two-and-a-half hours after the rain stopped play as you have to factor in lunch, too," updates Nagraj from Old Trafford.
4190,1stInnings$Stephen Kissoon: "The best case scenario for NZ is to lose overs and come out to bowl with overcast conditions. If Bout can hoop it around in the first hours and Kohli and Sharma goes early then its on like Donkey Kong."
4190,1stInnings$Apoorva: "Tell you what Dev, in these conditions, I'd rather fancy India playing 8/20 overs by Ferguson and Boult, rather than 20/50." --- I totally agree with you. And tell you what, even if it hadn't rained, Ferguson, Boult, and Santner could have posed a threat on this pitch
4190,1stInnings$Sandeep3sai : "Everyone's prepared for Boult but mind it Henry and Fregurson will be out of syllabus for India "
4190,1stInnings$Gurunarayanan: "Who was the commentator who conducted quiz contests during rain break. Please call him.. " --- Shashank Kishore is currently bowling grenades to Karthik Krishnaswamy at office-corridor cricket. You'll have to put up with me
4190,1stInnings$Praveen: "If it's going to be a 20 overs match, India will be happy with the batting lineup they have especially the hitters hardik, pant, dhoni, DK, Jadeja"
4190,1stInnings$3.40pm "The intensity of the rain has reduced significantly," reports Sambit from Old Trafford. "It's sawdust drizzle now and bare-headed grounds staff can be seen on the field."
4190,1stInnings$And for those wondering, we will start losing overs two hours after interruption - so that's 4:01pm local time
4190,1stInnings$Piyush Marda: "Too many have called in sick today at work. Presume getting well would take another day?"
4190,1stInnings$James: "Everyone seems to forget India were bowled out by NZ for 188 on a better wicket in the warm up match, game on" --- Game on if the rain's off
4190,1stInnings$Schnell: "In the swiss alps region and its sunny here with few scattered clouds." --- How about Swiss for the next World Cup?
4190,1stInnings$Stats wizard Shiva Jayaraman is here to entertain you during the rain break: Here is a fun Bhuvneshwar Kumar v Mohammed Shami debate based on numbers. Bhuvneshwar's strike rate in the first-46 overs this World Cup before this match - 62; his strike in this match - 49. Shami's SR in the first 46 overs in this World Cup - 20.44. Assuming the same strike rate ratio, Shami would've taken two more wickets from 8.1 overs.
4190,1stInnings$Bhuvneshwar's Economy in the first 46 overs - 5.21. Shami's economy - 4.9. Bhuvneshwar's economy in this match 3.67. Assuming the same ratio, Shami would've conceded two runs fewer from 8.1 overs.
4190,1stInnings$Hypothetically, India's 46-over target would've been 229 instead of 237 had Shami played instead of Bhuvneshwar. Hypothesis much?
4190,1stInnings$Danish: "One off the biggest question for this world cup " is dhoni retiring after world cup 2k19"?" --- Shhhhhhh. We know the answer, but we won't spill the beans
4190,1stInnings$Tanmay Bansal: "On the American East Coast, and thought I'd stick to cricinfo for half the day and catch up on all office work after the match is over. Seems like an extra day might be taken for my work too...thanks for all the especially interesting commentary" --- Cheers, we aim to please
4190,1stInnings$andrew: "Regarding Munro, he is a good enough T20 batter to play for NZ in that format, but he has never looked to have the technique or temperament to be a good ODI batter. Doesn't get enough singles, and doesn't have the range of shots required to come in and make an impact down the order. Bring on Blundell."
4190,1stInnings$Dil Sidhu: "Dear Muthu could you please show us some Bhangra moves to entertain us? As this Semi Final is getting boring by the minute. " --- Lol, are you kidding me? I might be good at some Dappankuthu, though. Heard R Ashwin is the man for Bhangra these days. Speaking of Ashwin, he has claimed five wickets for Nottinghamshire in county cricket
4190,1stInnings$3.20pm Right, Sambit Bal has some good news as well as bad news from Old Trafford. Good news first: It's gotten brighter. Hmmm, bad news: still raining and the super soppers are at work.
4190,1stInnings$Vipul Patel: "What happens if the match goes to a reserve day? The match continues from the previous day or its a fresh start? Hope its not the later one!!" --- If this one-day international becomes a two-day international, we will restart from where we leave today
4190,1stInnings$Prasad: "in reference to your reply on Sammi's comment - if Munro cant adapt on slow tracks, cant play spin...uh...isnt he better off sticking to those domestics only in NZ with true bounce and good pace to chuck his hands thru the ball? NZ could find a better opener..." --- He did adapt to the slower pitches in the CPL last year, but his weak technique has been exposed this World Cup. Guptill, too, has had a horror tournament. Time for NZ to find new openers. I would have taken a punt on Blundell at some point...Dashing wicketkeeper-batsman with several unorthodox shots in his repertoire and isn't bad v spin
4190,1stInnings$Mukundhan: "I hope, somewhere among the crowd, Sir Alex Ferguson is sitting and tapping his watch to spur positive action from the umpires!!!" --- My colleague and hero Anuj Vignesh who is a massive Manchester United fan replies: "I hope Sir Alex Ferguson returns to the other Old Trafford and take over managerial duties again."
4190,1stInnings$Jay Duraikkanna: "I feel for Shami. Sitting out after putting such a good show is just not right. :( "
4190,1stInnings$Pushkaraj: "I had scheduled a meeting with colleagues here in Bengaluru, today at 4 pm IST (11:30 AM GMT), but they scolded me for doing so as they wanted to watch the match and ordered to postpone it to tomorrow. I postponed it to tomorrow at 3 pm (10:30 AM GMT). Now, if rain washes out the rest of tonight, looks like I will have to reschedule it again. What's the probability of that, Deiva?" --- Things look rather bleak for now. And rain forecast until 7pm local time
4190,1stInnings$Sammi: "Unpopular opinion but I think NZ should include Colin Munro for Matt Henry. I don't think the bowling would take a hit as on slow pitches, CdG, Neesham, and Santner are deadly and Boult and Ferguson makes it 5 bowlers with KW and Munro as 6 and 7 options if needed. Have Latham and Nichols open and try Guptil and Munro's power in the middle. Latham, Nicholls, Williamson, Taylor, Guptil, Munro, CdG, Neesham, Santner, Boult, Ferguson. Still a strong bowling lineup with a much better batting lineup imo. " --- Sure, Munro has the power, but then again on slow pitches he struggles. And slotting him in the middle order means he has to tackle spin, which is again a problem for him.
4190,1stInnings$3.11pm The rain is still steady, and is forecast to linger a while longer ... the cut-off time tonight is two hours after normal end of play, so 8pm local time, but the match referee can give an extra hour if they think it'll get a result
4190,1stInnings$Right, here's Deiva to stare at some puddles for a while...
4190,1stInnings$Shafi Ur Rahman: "Can we have the next world cup in desert please!" Well, yes, you can actually. The next football World Cup will be in Qatar in 2022 ... not that anyone really wants that either!
4190,1stInnings$Gareth: ""an annoying band drifting in off the Irish Sea" followed by "a secondary band to the north which might swing round for another" sounds like a pretty dodgy concert " Yes, sounds like the sort of cacophony that still pops up when I put my iPod on shuffle
4190,1stInnings$Jay Duraikkanna: "WoaH! Wait... what? People still use iPod? #MindBlown" I know! Somehow I haven't lost mine yet ...
4190,1stInnings$3.07pm It's been more than an hour now ... but a while yet until the overs start getting chipped away. I suspect New Zealand will be happy to call their innings quits and try their luck with DLS. They'll get more runs off that than two overs of Bumrah!
4190,1stInnings$Here's something else to read while we wait for the rain to pass: Veteran F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton has been to over 600 races, and the one he rates as the best ever happened half a century back at the British Grand Prix (the next instalment is this weekend at Silverstone). He explains why
4190,1stInnings$Ian: "Weather wise this has been the worst WC with 4-5 matches being affected or completely washed out due to rain. Time to change time table for World cups to avoid such occurrences in the future. Anybody brave enough to publish this comment??" Ummm ... okay, but I'm not sure you've provided any actual solutions!
4190,1stInnings$2.52pm Bhagyesh: "Rather than posting comments someone please give us rain update." It is raining. Will that do? No? Okay, it looks like an annoying band drifting in off the Irish Sea... it ought to pass soon, though there is a secondary band to the north which might swing round for another delay later. But I'm pretty confident we'll get back out there soon...
4190,1stInnings$If you want a nice picture of the miserable scene, then Varun Shetty has uploaded one to the Live Report, just for you...
4190,1stInnings$Vinod: "I am following cricinfo live coverage from Sydney. It is midnight here. Can you please give me wake up call when match starts? So I can have some sleep that will help me to my office on time in morning. " Download the App and sign up for alerts, Vinod! You'll be pinged with gripping cricket updates every minute of every day! And what more, frankly, could anyone wish for!
4190,1stInnings$*Disclaimer, not actually every minute of every day ... we are very selective and targeted with our alerts... thankyoubye
4190,1stInnings$Saurav: "My office is next to the stadium, and rain is very heavy now! Do ICC not know that Manchester is the rain capital of the world? There is no summer here!" How rude! I lived there for three years at University, and I definitely saw the sun at least once.
4190,1stInnings$shravan: "Walked into the bar to watch the last 4 overs and the Indian chase. That worked out! " Sounds like the start of a bad joke ... did the barman ask, "why the long face?"
4190,1stInnings$2.46pm Naresh M: "Why is everyone talking about a close contest? As an Indian fan I want this to be a one sided game and Indian batsmen should chase the score comfortably." Well, you know, speculation, tension, nerves, uncertainty... all the ingredients for top-level sport. But yes, you are right. It could just as easily be a walk in the park for India!
4190,1stInnings$Naimah: "Nice and sunny down here in South west. Not just today, but for a couple of weeks now. How 'bright' would the semifinal have been in Southampton! " Slightly grey but dry in London too. Ho hum! Sit tight, it'll pass
4190,1stInnings$Shar: "I woke up "early" to watch this match - at 6:00am PST in California! Literally the next moment, match delayed by rain. So disappointing! Here's hoping my work is slow for the day so I can watch a good second innings! (Assuming NZ doesn't bat again, which looks true from looking at the hourly weather forecast.)"
4190,1stInnings$2.40pm So, to reiterate, no overs lost for two hours, so we just sit tight for now. Another hour and 20 to go ...
4190,1stInnings$"Does DLS take into account that Bumrah has 2 overs left??" asks JoiningUnrelatedDots on Twitter... no, it does not, which could yet be unfortunate for India. But on balance, they've got to be the happier team at this stage of proceedings. New Zealand's innings was an exercise in gritty restraint, but there's been very little momentum at any stage...
4190,1stInnings$Mrudul: "What do Cricinfo's commentators usually do during a rain delay?" Make tea, and use Statsguru to sort opening batsman by strike-rate in alphabetic order of the venue at which they made their debut. Because we have nothing better to do...
4190,1stInnings$Umar: "NZ dotted so many deliveries, didn't study overcast conditions, easily they could've been 30-40 runs more ATM, making it interesting near 270-280, 5/over would be peanuts for this Indian batting whatever conditions may be" Coulda woulda shoulda. They made their choice to bat through their overs. Too much intent and they could have been bowled out by now ...
4190,1stInnings$2.38pm Some big news in Indian football (and no, that is not an oxymoron, ye of little faith!), where the question of which of the I-League or the ISL is the top division has dragged on for three years. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) announced today that they are planning to give away the prestigious AFC Champions League slot to the Indian Super League, where India's captain Virat Kohli co-owns FC Goa
4190,1stInnings$2.30pm Robert Lamb: "Many comments on the difficult nature of the batting surface and no doubt it isn't easy, but surely the score is more indicative of NZ's batting talent. Although Williamson has scored heavily in this WC his strike rate is much lower than the other big run getters and yet he is head and shoulders above most of his NZ team mates. The simple reality is that NZ's batting is not at the level of the other top teams and their ability to stay in the competition is due to their well balanced bowling." I can't disagree with that. But equally, if their bowling can produce a decent allround performance on this pitch, we might yet have a contest!
4190,1stInnings$Chintan: "Do I have to praise ESPNcricinfo to get my comments in??! ;)" If you like, we are all suckers for suck-ups!
4190,1stInnings$Adjtya: ""This is really insane from the organisers. Manchester has been experiencing rain throughout the World Cup and with the technology available why couldn't they change the venue well in advance"" Have you seen how many cameras go into a World Cup broadcast? You can't just uproot those logistics at the whim of a long-range forecast...
4190,1stInnings$Dharmesh Basapa: "You can't get bored even in this situation when the match is suspended due to rain as espncricinfo's continuous comments by other passionate cricket followers and essential data released by them every regular interval makes your day. Hats off espncricinfo !!!" Why thank you, you are very welcome! I shall pass onto the Statscave, to make sure they keep pumping out the facts!
4190,1stInnings$Anudeep: "So anyone thinks - another thriller semifinal coming up similar to SA vs NZ in 2015 - where rain stopped play when ABD and Miller were going for hitting ??? " I was watching that match back the other day, proper extended highlights for once. Unquestionably one of the greatest knock-out games of all time. In its own way, right up there with the 1999 semi at Edgbaston ...
4190,1stInnings$2.28pm Nikhil S: "It's been raining for almost half an hour - how heavy is the rain? Also, if the match continues today, will the soggy outfield affect India when they come out to bat?" Unfortunately Nagraj tells me it is getting heavier, which is rather as the umpires feared when they took the players off. As for the outfield, it's hard to tell. It might slow up what had been a very rapid outfield, but it might also affect New Zealand with a wet ball.
4190,1stInnings$2.20pm Bhargava: "Sir please tell why on Earth apply DLS today if there is a reserve day tomorrow ?" I think the idea is to give the paying public (and the TV companies) the day of drama that they have paid for ... We want entertainment, dammit! Never mind cricketing justice ...
4190,1stInnings$Sunny: "I never understand the DL system, how come the target is more than the team scored even after 5 wickets fell.!? Would the team batting first be advantageous in DL system.!?" The theory is that New Zealand have resisted going for big shots to keep wickets in hand for a late push. In an adjusted chase, India would know to go for it from earlier in proceedings. Of course, it can't fully take into account quality bowling / inept batting, but it's on balance as fair a system as has yet been used...
4190,1stInnings$2.12pm So, as a guide to how this might pan out, if New Zealand didn't bat again in their innings, India's 20-over score would be 148. And their DLS-adjusted target for 46 overs would be 237
4190,1stInnings$Vishal: "This SF is impossible to call at this stage. The way NZ is batting it seems like 200 could be more than enough but cant really tell until the first 10 overs of Indian batting. Is NZ being too cautious or India bowlers bowling impeccable lengths or the weather/pitch playing a part. I think its a combination of all 3."
4190,1stInnings$Pabbineedi: "I remember India vs England going into day 2 in 1999 world cup. Is there any other match that went like this, later?" Indeed, and that didn't go too well for the hosts!
4190,1stInnings$2.05pm So, a clarification on the rain provisions for the semi-finals. Every effort will be made to finish the match today, but there is a reserve day tomorrow, if needs be. So we can expect DLS to kick in if the rain lingers, with 20 overs of the second innings constituting a game. But hopefully we won't need to worry about that. We won't lose any overs for two hours, and the lights are already on and will carry on burning into the night if needs be

4190,1stInnings$2pm Now then, the umpires are having a chat ... and the covers are coming on! There's some concern about what too much rain will do for an already sticky deck, so the umpires are keen to keep the conditions as equal for both teams as possible. It's not raining heavily yet but it does seem that more is on its way.
4190,1stInnings$Jordan Smith: "I want to note that "the pitch" has been a demon in the last 3 games NZ have played. It's strange, though.. Why have all NZ games been sub-300 games where every other game in the world cup has expected scores of 300+? I just get the suspicion that maybe NZ just bat overly cautiously and rely on their bowling to win them matches. NZ were thumped when Fergo didn't play" Well, he is playing today ... so we shall see. I'm pretty sure that this won't be enough, whatever they finish with... but it's not over yet
4190,1stInnings$Miller : How is the crowd for today? Do the crowd need to buy their tickets again?" The crowd is sparse ... tickets from yesterday are valid, but not for resale. Daft if you ask me
4190,1stInnings$10.25am Five minutes to go... which side is on top right now? Have your say on the Live Report
4190,1stInnings$Meanwhile, not that this has got anything to do with cricket or whatever, but here's a quiz about which footballer you are, because I've been asked to plug it and I'm an amenable sort. Mind you, it seems to think I'm Ronaldo, so it is clearly fatally flawed ...
4190,1stInnings$10.17am Nagraj is off on one. "Former England fast bowler Derek Pringle sighing: "Get out there when it is sunny." He is right. Not sure why ICC have to be pedantic about start timing - it has been sunny all morning and they could easily started at 1000." Actually I disagree, but then I was brought up in the days of the NatWest Trophy and early starts being swing-dominated wicket-fests. These matches have been starting half-an-hour earlier than the standard start time all tournament. And you've got to give the public a chance to get to the ground, especially if they've been scattered to last-minute accommodation in all parts of Greater Manchester.
4190,1stInnings$10.13am Paul: "Can the stats person confirm when did India last play NZ in a world cup match? I just heard it was 16 years back i.e. 2003 World Cup." LMSGTFY ... yes indeed, it was the 2003 World Cup ... that's a remarkable hiatus for two senior nations, especially serial reachers of the knock-out stages...
4190,1stInnings$10.07am Less than half an hour until the resumption. Henry Nicholls has been chatting about the first day... "The conditions weren't what both sides thought," he says. "The nature of the World Cup and the pressure has added to the [low] totals. Let's hope the surface keeps getting tougher and tougher for the batters."
4190,1stInnings$"Certainly hope that [chasing will add some pressure]... I think our seam attack up top is so important."
4190,1stInnings$Meanwhile Bhuvi has been out in the middle practising his yorkers ... and he will be bowling first-up to complete his over...
4190,1stInnings$9.53am Nagraj is still lurking around the fringes. "Yuzi Chahal is having a word with Shane Warne - and they are talking bowling. Warne is in his element - using hands, wrists, feet, to expand on his thoughts. Chahal now just needs India to make the final."
4190,1stInnings$Ankit Sharma: "The only piece of silverware England men's cricket team have in their cabinet is still the 2010 ICC T20 World Cup. I don't think that they even came close to winning any major trophy barring 2013 Champions Trophy in the last decade.This has to be their best chance!" Ah yes, the 2013 final ... the forgotten glitch in the matrix when England, under Alastair Cook and with Jonathan Trott as their No.3 dynamo, were actually quite good at a certain type of one-day cricket. And they might have won it too, but for rain turning the final into a T20 ...
4190,1stInnings$9.34am Of course, there's another semi-final looming large, down at Edgbaston on Thursday ... England have come close in global tournaments throughout this decade, but their trophy cupboard remains barren and craving for some silverware. George Dobell and Jarrod Kimber were on the latest episode of our Talking World Cup podcast, talking about how that could change and how far they've come from the debacle of 2015 (here on Apple Podcasts)
4190,1stInnings$Satya V: "If the skies are blue and there is rain forecast for later today, why don't they start early? They could have announced yesterday that we will try for an early start weather permitting." But that would mean getting out of bed, and getting dressed and stuff ... why ruin a nice day by being efficient?
4190,1stInnings$Rich: "Surely this works against New Zealand? A well set Taylor yesterday gave them a chance of more than a run a ball, but he essentially has to start again on what appeared to be a difficult pitch to start" Yes. Though he could just decide, "what the hell", and start lumping it from ball one
4190,1stInnings$9.28am Nagraj Gollapudi is up and around at Old Trafford, and has been spying on the India warm-ups. "Hardik Pandya is not limping or anything so he is fit," he reports. Hurrah!
4190,1stInnings$9.23am Ashique: "Trent Boult holds the key for Newzealand if they have any chance of winning this game. I have a feeling it will be a last over finish." Indeed ... such a key weapon, particularly given his impressive record against Rohit Sharma. But also, don't forget these 23 deliveries remaining in New Zealand's innings. Run-a-ball would get them up to 234 ... anything more or less than that could have huge ramifications for how this game pans out.
4190,1stInnings$9.15am Morning all! Wakey, wakey, rise and shine ... and let's try this all over again shall we?
4190,1stInnings$Welcome back to Old Trafford for the first semi-final of the 2019 World Cup, where I'm pleased to report that blue skies have been sighted. Despite a threat of more rain this afternoon, we have a mere 53.5 overs to wade through today (or just 23.5 to constitute a result...) so it's safe to presume that this contest will be settled on the field after all.
4190,1stInnings$Play will resume at 10.30am... talk among yourselves for a bit ...
4190,1stInnings$Shikhar Pathak: "How do i explain my Irish friends this sentence. "Day2 of 1 day international."" Because cricket... it's sophisticated, innit...
4190,1stInnings$***
4190,1stInnings$6.25pm So ... that's your lot for tonight. No-one seems to want to speak at such a critical juncture of the tournament, and who can blame them. So much up for grabs, and still very much within both teams' grasps. From myself, Andrew Miller, Deiva Muthu and Chandan Duorah, good night, and join us again fresh and early tomorrow for more fun and frolics! (rain permitting, of course ...)
4190,1stInnings$PLAY IS SUSPENDED! There we go, it's all over for tonight, but very much not all over for this crucial semi-final. New Zealand will resume where this innings left off, on 211 for 5 with 23 balls of their innings still to come. It's advantage India... but who knows what might yet pan out. Play will resume at 10.30am
4190,1stInnings$Sriks: "Here's by last and hopefully the best shot at getting my comment published: Wanted to RAVE about the unwavering and rain proof spirit of the espncricinfo commentary team. Keep it floating for 2.5 more potential games! " Hurrah, you have snuck in at the death, Sriks ... here's to unfettered optimism!
4190,1stInnings$Surya Teja: "I have been firing at ECB on twitter for scheduling World Cup in this season. Thanks to them, by which I get to see a Two-Day International game, being an Indian fan, I don't support this because India would've easily won if there was no rain. But this game is on, evenly poised. Semifinals, WC, pressure, chasing, overcast conditions. Its not easy for India with Swing Boult, Pace Ferguson and Rain again. " Which season would you rather cricket was played in? Winter?!
4190,1stInnings$6.20pm The full covers have come back on ... it's spitting with rain. If you've got plans for tomorrow, cancel them.
4190,1stInnings$6.18pm This is daft ... there's a reserve day, I can't see how we can get going in time... but still we wait. It's wet underfoot, there are still big puddles being mopped up. And we know that India would rather come back tomorrow.
4190,1stInnings$Jez: "I reckon this scenario has cost NZ about 20 runs when you factor in the lost impetus and added planning India now has in the bag. Could probably have taken 237 and been happy with it, now I expect we'll see different conditions and India waltz into the final after a full day to plan their chase. This whole scenario is daft." Indeed. The fact that they'll now need to resume for 3.5 overs tomorrow - two of which will be bowled by Bumrah - could be really tough.
4190,1stInnings$6.15pm Right, here we go. This could be definitive. The host broadcaster is still talking about 6.35pm being the last possible moment to get back onto the field ... but there are some huge puddles still to be cleaned up... I can't believe they are going to get back out there... in fact, the umpires are inspecting right now...
4190,1stInnings$6.12pm Fernando speaks! "It's raining again. I think we're done for today."
4190,1stInnings$venkat: "On the note calling Roof and enjoying cricket in Fresh air, why not try a roof that can be opened and closed like a garage parking door? I know it requires lots of effort to build that kinda roof but nothing is impossible" Still requires planning permission ... and cricket grounds are rather bigger than tennis courts!
4190,1stInnings$Deepak Gupta: "The Miller Park Baseball Stadium here in Milwaukee USA has retractable roof. When not raining, one can enjoy fresh air; when raining, match continuation is more important than fresh air." Cricket grounds are also bigger than baseball grounds. I know ... I was watching a match the other day at a venue that England had hoped to use for the World Cup, but couldn't make it fit their requirements...
4190,1stInnings$6.07pm never mind all this debate about rain delays. Here's the definitive view on the situation from Sambit Bal and Andrew Fernando, chatting to Varun Shetty on the Live Report. TL:DR... how ICC have won with the reserve day, how Sri Lanka does reserve days better, and how Sambit is sort of a liar... fighting talk!
4190,1stInnings$6.04pm Six minutes ... tick, tock, tick, tock ...
4190,1stInnings$Waqas Abdullah: "What a bizarre CWC, 1st many pool games washed-out or impacted and now semi-final.. Instead of going to t20, or DL etc. ICC should seriously think about stadium roofs.. I remember MCG tried. Anyone know what happened to that trial? " Never going to happen. It wasn't the MCG, it was some massive warehouse in the docklands. Never mind the fact that part of the fun of cricket is being in the fresh air, you'd have to deal with the planning permission issues. Who's going to put up with a rank great roof blocking their view of Lord's or The Oval?
4190,1stInnings$It's drizzling again ... This could be curtains ... I daresay we'll hear something definitive at 6.10pm... it'll take until beyond 6.35pm to make the ground playable.
4190,1stInnings$Rishabh: "I pray that rain should seal it for the day so India bat for complete 50 overs tomorrow " Rishabh knows. And so do Virat and Rohit, I'll wager ...
4190,1stInnings$As we continue to wait, here's some badminton wisdom from India's battle-hardened star Parupalli Kashyap: The former world no.7 has struggled with injuries in recent times, and knows qualifying for Tokyo 2020 is an uphill task. It hasn't stopped him from competing though, and he hopes his determination to fight on inspires the next generation.
4190,1stInnings$5.56pm Less than 15 minutes until we discover the fate of this soggy contest. The tension is palpable!
4190,1stInnings$Manish K: "deGrandhomme, like Jacob Oram, is a very different bowler when conditions suit his type of bowling.. " Innit
4190,1stInnings$Prashant: "Reduction of overs due to rain or other factors and applying the famous DL rule in a 50 over game is ok as long as one can atleast play 35 overs. If one reduces to 20 overs then it is a change in format to T20 and then the purpose of the 50 over format is defeated. Needs change of rules " I tend to agree with this. DL (and latterly DLS) is the best format yet devised for rain delays, but it hasn't fully adjusted for the power batting era. Especially when the overs are reduced to such a point that the risk of losing wickets isn't offset by a reduction in biffing quality lower down the order.
4190,1stInnings$5.52pm "The hover cover was removed for a few minutes, but back on..." says Nagraj Gollapudi, always the first with the big exclusives.
4190,1stInnings$Manish: "deGrandhomme a challenge ?? are you serious ?? " Err ... yes. Have you seen him bowl in damp New Zealand conditions?
4190,1stInnings$"Umpire Nigel Llong was using a mop for a moment though,* adds Nagraj. "The side covers are back on."
4190,1stInnings$5.48pm Ramesh: "I think New Zealand would be favorites in a 148 off 20 scenario in these conditions. Especially with their seam friendly bowling attack. NZ would want play to resume today but India would definitely rather keep things for tomorrow." I wouldn't necessarily make them favourites, but I agree they would very definitely be much better placed than they currently are. Boult and Ferguson, and deGrandhomme in these conditions, would be a serious challenge.
4190,1stInnings$Virendra: "Question- What if play resumes for 20 overs today but didn't get complete due to further rain? What will happen tomorrow?" We pick up to finish whatever has been started ... so if it's 10 runs to win from five balls, that's your lot! Isn't cricket hilarious?
4190,1stInnings$There will be a further, and surely final, inspection at 6.10pm. That feels like an attempt at bet-hedging from the umpires ... torn between trying to get this finished tonight to suit the crowd, and being realistic about the match situation and the conditions. Sit tight!
4190,1stInnings$5.42pm Hello again... and it may yet be goodbye before long, as the umpires have just gone into the India dressing room to relay their findings from out in the middle. Presumably they will then go and have a chat with New Zealand, but you can be pretty sure that Kohli and Co. would sooner sack this off and come back refreshed tomorrow. Any reduction of overs in these conditions eats into India's edge in the contest...
4190,1stInnings$Siddhant: "Hoping that Ted from how I met your mother continues to do his rain dance and the match resumes tomorrow. Will certainly be a tad difficult for India if the match were to resume today."
4190,1stInnings$5.25pm THE RAIN HAS STOPPED in Manchester. Oh it's true, it's damn true (in Kurt Angle's voice). Some of the covers are being peeled off. But there are massive puddles of water on the field. Nagraj says that the umpires are out for the first round of inspection. Play must resume by 18:36 BST for a chase of 20 overs to take place this evening. And it's time to welcome back Miller.
4190,1stInnings$James: "Good thing I did not take sick leave today. Probably not tomorrow either. Saving it for finals!!!"

4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 1 run, a hint of width on a good length, cracked firmly out to deep point, good reassuring connection to open the account for the morning
4190,1stInnings$10.30am Right, out come the players. Five balls of Bhuvi's over to come, Ross Taylor on strike, and a diet of yorkers to come ... ramps to the fore!

4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Latham, no run, tremendous ball ... wide yorker, Latham tries to run it down to third man but misses

4190,1stInnings$46.4
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Latham, 2 runs, swinging gently into the toes on a yorker length, should be just the single to backward square, but Karthik's throw is weak and Latham sprints back for two

4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Latham, 1 run, tapped to the off-side, and another sharp single, running for everything now. A good positive start... but a boundary would be a bonus
4190,1stInnings$Kohli immediately banishes Karthik and drops behind square himself
4190,1stInnings$46.6
4190,1stInnings$2
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Taylor, 2 runs, excellent from Taylor, whipped from a full length past the close fielders in the ring, and the leg-side sweepers have to make a lot of ground to gather. Back they come for another couple.

4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, full-toss to start, but Latham can't capitalise, flicked to wide mid-on for the single. He'll be disappointed to miss out on a rare loose ball. Tight line to off stump though, which cramped his intentions

4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Taylor, 2 runs, another full toss! He's striving for the yorker but can't nail it this time either. Taylor eases into line, flicks into the gap at midwicket, and back they jog for another two
4190,1stInnings$47.3
4190,1stInnings$1
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, hauled round the corner with an ambitious mow across the line. Backward square gathers, as Taylor doesn't quite pick the slower ball

4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Latham, 2 runs, reverses the stance for the ramp to fine leg! Sizing up the anticipated yorker, and getting good bat on it too, gathered inside the rope

4190,1stInnings$W
4190,1stInnings$Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, OUT, tight line, slower ball ... clipped to midwicket ... and it's a direct hit! India know they've got their man ... Jadeja's shy is pinpoint, and Taylor is walking before the decision is given. He was turning for the second, an automatic call, and a correct one too, but it took a moment of brilliance in the field to end a fighting innings

4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Latham, OUT, absolutely belted out through midwicket, and a sensational take from Jadeja! Latham seized on the length, sizing up the agenda-setting six, but Jaddu tracked back, leapt high, plucked it in two hands, and kept his balance inside the rope to make it two wickets in two balls, and both the set men!

4190,1stInnings$4
4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Santner, FOUR runs, first boundary of the morning! A poor ball from Bhuvi, too much width across the left-hander, and a slower ball too. Santner thrives on sitting back in his crease, and was well placed to smoke it through the covers off the back foot

4190,1stInnings$Kumar to Henry, OUT, crashed mightily into the leg side ... but not mighty enough!

4190,2ndInnings$11am Good day, everyone. NZ need to find a way past Rohit and Kohli if they are to stay in this. Rohit and Rahul walk down the stairs and tap gloves. On Tuesday, the pitch was quite zippy in the early exchanges and then suddenly slowed down in the middle overs. This morning it played pretty slow as well. Over to you Boult. He runs in from over the wicket, Rahul to take first strike

4190,2ndInnings$10.55am So, just a short ten-minute turnaround before India begin their chase on what has so far proven to be a tricky pitch. Can Rohit and Co. transcend the conditions? Deiva Muthu will be here to talk you through it shortly.
4190,2ndInnings$James: "236 estimated by the DL system. That thing is kinda creepy right now. Not a bad estimate at all. Now fingers crossed NZ bowlers can do what they're good at."
4190,2ndInnings$10.51am So ... 28 runs added in 23 balls this morning. It might well have been more but for some heroics in the field from Ravi Jadeja... two blinding moments in consecutive balls to puncture a promising start to New Zealand's day. India leave the field to backslaps and handshakes at a job reasonably well done...

4190,2ndInnings$Henry to Sharma, OUT, What a cracker from Matt Henry. Rohit gone in the second over. Fuller than a good length, angling in towards off stump, straightening away so very late. The tight line teases Rohit into feeling for the ball with his feet rooted to the crease. Rohit has a tendency to fiddle with such balls early in his innings. The first couple of balls simply came in with the angle, but this one curved away. He is squared up and can only feather is behind to Latham
