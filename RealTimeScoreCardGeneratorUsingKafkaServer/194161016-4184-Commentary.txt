4184,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Lewis, no run, gets this to bend back in, Lewis leaves but he did so getting well outside the line. Not sure that would've hit.
4184,1stInnings$Shubham S: "For me Mujeeb is the most underrated bowler in the tournament. He went for a lot of runs in the initial games, but after returning to the squad, he has been economical and has also struck at important junctures. He did it against India, then Pakistan, and he delivered some economical spells in the games played before these two."

4184,1stInnings$Ajay: "I know my comment wont be published But can you guys explain the net run rate calculation for Pakistan qualification to Semi-final. If they restrict Bangladesh for 100-150 (RR:2-3) and chase the target in 10-15 overs (RR:10), wont their run rate better than New Zealand. Then why is everyone saying that Pakistan will be eliminated if Bangladesh bats first." -- It's what happens over the course of nine games that matters, and not a one-off result that boosts NRR. Effectively, Pakistan will rue their shocker against West Indies.
4184,1stInnings$3.4
4184,1stInnings$4
4184,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, FOUR runs, makes room and slaps this back past the bowler. Although I'm not sure that's where he wanted to hit it. Lined him up as he was going to go over mid-on. He'll take the runs nonetheless

4184,1stInnings$Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, OUT, got him! Gayle has lost patience and his wicket in the process. Looked to back away to open up the off-side and swing big, but Dawlat saw him do that and fired this wider. Gayle looked to reach out to carve it away but ends up nicking it behind. Surely the last time we've seen Gayle at the 50-over World Cup.

4184,1stInnings$Shashank, the one problem with this format is, the teams who will not qualify to go ahead really don't give their absolute best in their last games perhaps due to lack of motivation. These are really dead rubbers which don't bring in lot of viewers too. Do you agree?" -- Doesn't but imagine what it means to a guy who is making his debut. It's still a World Cup game.

Firstly, Pakistan will have to win the toss and bat first (if they lost the toss and BD bat first, Pakistan's out).Moreover, then Pakistan will have to make exactly 350 and then beat BD by 312 runs;which means, you'll have to bowl them out under 38 runs. Simultaneously, Pakistan is out of the WC; and remember, that WI loss cost them the WC" --- Also, Bangladesh are a quality side, I think.

This was fired in full, drifted in a hint and Lewis completely misjudged the length. Went through with the sweep but surely he knew then and there that he was dead the moment this hit the pad. Wonder why the umpire didn't give it out initially. Oh dear, oh dear. Guess what? Impact comes back as umpire's call and I promise you this was not more than one millimeter outside off on impact. How lucky is he to survive? Mujeeb can't believe his luck. Ball tracking says this would've smashed middle and leg.

4184,1stInnings$Rashid Khan to Lewis, OUT, guess what? Rashid's got Lewis with a buffet ball. Absolutely short, begging to be smacked. Lewis rocked back to open up the leg side and pulled, but the timing was off. Got it off the toe end and the long-on fielder ran in to take an excellent catch. It's that man Nabi, who at 34 is still as fast as they come in the outfield. Excellent anticipation, he was on the move as the ball lodged in his hands but had complete control.

Nabi just gets it to hang in the air a bit, and Hope tries to go for the slog sweep but doesn't time it well enough to clear the deep midwicket fence. A grateful Rashid Khan has just take a couple of steps forward to complete the catch. Two set batsmen have given their wicket away in succession for West Indies, as Afghanistan chip away with wickets

4184,1stInnings$Sayed Shirzad to Holder, 2 runs, slower delivery on the pads, would you believe it if I say he only nudged it a little past short midwicket, but strolls back for the second. Sure, the fielder had to run in from the ropes, but the bowler could've done a lot better there. Eventually by the time he took off, the second was on. He was also limited by the fact that there was no one backing up. Very poor from Afghanistan

It was full, but could have been darting down the leg side, unless it stays with umpire's call. There seems to be no inside edge. Perhaps a touch too full to have employed the sweep. It's three-reds, and that's the end of Ikram Alikhil! He's played his hand in bringing Afghanistan close, but this was a bad time to have gotten out, and to the part-timer. But what a moment for Chris Gayle, in what should be his last World Cup innings. A smart catch, and now getting a teenager on the verge of a famous century!

4184,2ndInnings$Brathwaite to Asghar Afghan, OUT, good catch at long off by Holder! Thrown wide and full again, and Afghan shimmies across to get to that - it would have been a wide if he had missed - and he looked to go inside out. Toe-ends it down towards long off, and West Indies do well to keep big Jason Holder there for this steepling catch. Perfectly balanced, even though he lost his shades

4184,2ndInnings$Brathwaite to Rashid Khan, SIX runs, he has cleared long-off! Slower ball, Rashid backed away and held his shape before giving it the thump it needed. He was hitting it towards the long boundary but the timing was top notch. Not even Holder stood a chance

4184,2ndInnings$Imperative that Rashid not just hogs most of the strike but does all the hitting for Afghanistan if they're to still win. Question is do they believe?
