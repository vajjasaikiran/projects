West Indies were in a series of winning positions in both innings but couldn't slam the door shut. The defending champions showed their mettle to keep fighting back before coming out on top. Along with the England v Pakistan match, this is right near the top of the heap in terms of the best contest of the tournament so far. Pleasure to have you join us for the ride. For Alex Malcolm, Ranjith and the rest of the scoring team, I'm Peter Della Penna. Make sure to come back tomorrow for live coverage of the showdown in Bristol between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Take care for now!

Aaron Finch: "We just kept hanging in there. From 4 for 30-odd to be able to fight back, that partnership between Alex Carey and Steve Smith to get us a little deeper and then Nathan Coulter-Nile to play the way he did was exceptional. It's not ideal for the top order to miss out and put us in that position but even with the ball we hung in there and I'm really proud of the boys today."

Jason Holder: "Obviously disappointed. I thought we were well in the game there. Just a few irresponsible shots when we probably just needed to tap it around a little bit more. Having said that, I still think there's lots of positives to take out of this game." Asked about the biggest moment, the captain says, "We dropped Coulter-Nile when he was about 60-odd and he got about another 30 runs. That was one pivotal moment but obviously the batting. If we came here at the start of the day and limited Australia to 280, we'd have taken that. The batters need to take the responsibility and knock it off. It's still early days. We have to be more consistent. When we have teams down, we have to keep them down."

Nathan Coulter-Nile is Man of the Match - "I didn't think I'd get that much [92] but happy to. I got a bit of a spray for getting out when Smithy was on 80 in one of the practice games so I thought I'd just try to stick around for a bit. Luck went my way. A couple fell short, I got dropped, but that's the way cricket goes. We back ourselves to defend anything. If we had got bowled out for 150, we'd still back ourselves. The wicket was a bit up and down but I got settled in and got used to it at the end. It looked like West Indies were on track the whole way until Starcky took three or four at the end there."

Before the post-match particulars, here's a little preview of the most anticipated match of the 2019 French Open: Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal!

6.32 Australia leak a series of boundaries at the end there but it matters little. This match was one of the best of the tournament so far, see-sawing back and forth almost from beginning to end. West Indies had Australia under heavy pressure in the first 20 overs but let the pressure go with some costly misses - Smith on 26 and Coulter-Nile on 61. The umpiring in this match left a lot to be desired but West Indies were bailed out numerous times on DRS. The Shimron Hetmyer runout and Andre Russell's regrettable slog vs. Starc were the hammer blows that gave Australia they high ground once and for all.

C-mant: "There are a lot of linchpins in this match!!!! Coulter-Nile and deserve to be player of the match....But to be honest, true man of the match for this is Steve Smith for holding the innings together and providing bowler something to defend......" No shortage of candidates for the post-match gong.

As bad as the umpiring has been, West Indies had DRS at their disposal to neutralize the umpiring errors through this chase. Some of their shot selection and targeting of bowlers has been quite puzzling though and they can only blame themselves for this collapse.

Starc to Cottrell, OUT, yorker makes it five for Starc! Man of the Match just about locked up for him turning this chase haywire for West Indies. Cottrell backed away trying to make room over the off side but it was full and straight and shatters the stumps.

Starc to Holder, OUT, Starc is winning this for Australia! The pressure looked like it was getting to Holder after missing out on a meaty full toss the previous ball. Starc follows it up with a bouncer on the leg stump line, he goes to pull but is late and it thuds off the gloves. The ball balloons to Zampa at short fine leg, he only needs to take three steps forward from the ring to claim this at chest height.

Starc to Brathwaite, OUT, slower ball brings a wicket! It was an attempted yorker with plenty of pace off it, met by Brathwaite at shin height as a low full toss, but completely miscues it off the toe of the bat high over mid-on. Finch backpedals 10 yards back and to the left before taking it with ease. The tension rises a few notches. Can Holder shepherd the tail across the line?

Umm Abeeha: "Aggressive captaincy by Finch bowling his main bowlers now with 2 overs of the 5th bowler remaining. Other captains would have bowled their 5th bowler now, keeping the main bowlers for the crunch. Looking for wickets sensibly. Smart and brave." Well, except for the part where he hasn't offered a slip since Brathwaite came in and there have been quite a few edges gone begging.

Russell continues backing away from leg stump for a mow over midwicket, Starc targets leg stump and Russell gets a leading edge skier over point. Maxwell runs out from the circle taking this over the shoulder a third of the way to the rope. Sensational grab, 8/10 on degree of difficulty but it was bog standard for Maxwell. Whatever Holder said to Russell at the start of the over to have him rein in his aggression failed to produce the desired effect from the captain. Totally unnecessary from Russell at this stage.

Eventful first session of play in the chase. DRS was ever-present, or perhaps not present enough in the case of the missed no-ball call on the delivery prior to Gayle being dismissed. Here to take over for the next sequence of play once more is Alex Malcolm. Take it away Alex!

Pritesh : "@Adrian: When the DRS system refers to Umpire's call, there is not enough evidence to overturn the call on the field. In American Football, we call this "inconclusive evidence". Ha(wk)eye is a science, it may be advanced and very accurate/precise, but imperfect. So if it is not 100% out or not out, it will not overturn the call on the field. "

Glenn Maxwell into the attack, spin for the first time from Australia, around the stumps to Hope with no slip.

After waiting 12 seconds while chatting with Hope, Gayle finally calls for the review.... Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg-stump on umpire's call. Three strikes (on DRS) and you're out!

2.18 pm Australia end an over short, but a brilliant fightback nonetheless led by Smith and Coulter-Nile. West Indies paid for some inconsistent fielding though. Smith arguably should have been caught at deep fine leg on 26 but Cottrell misjudged the chance and Coulter-Nile was also grassed on a much simpler effort by Hetmyer on 61 at deep midwicket. The wides were also costly too, releasing the pressure after West Indies had Australia under the pump. Can West Indies chase this down? See what our MatchDay studio panel has to say.

In spite of that earlier misjudged chance by Cottrell, he made up for it later with this stunner to finally claim Smith at deep fine leg. Watch Sheldon Cottrell's sensational catch on the boundary. It came after Smith and Alex Carey initially led Australia's fightback to dig out of a major hole at 79 for 5. Watch how Smith and Carey put Australia back in the game (UK, IRE, AUS only).

Shortish length on off stump, Coulter-Nile laces a scorching pull toward Brathwaite at deep square leg, just evades his grasp running to his left and sliding at the last moment.

He tries to change direction late and loses his footing with a clumsy slip and slide. The ball lands a foot in front of him grasping forward in vain.

It was full and angled into Carey, who is forced into playing at the ball for the first time. Beaten playing around his pad and struck on off stump at first view. Indeed it's a red light on impact but he's hit just above the knee roll and ball-tracking shows Brathwaite's height generates enough bounce to clear the stumps by two inches. West Indies lose their review. Umpire Chris Gaffaney's sharp decision is upheld.

Mustafa Moudi: "Am not convinced with the idea of Finch opening for Aus just with an excuse of maintaining Left-Right Combination. Khawaja-Warner is the best Opening pair for Aussies but think Finch is being a bit selfish here and using his captaincy to choose his favourite slot. He's not in his best form and the cant score against quality bowling with the new ball. I expect Langer and Ponting to explain this to him !!" If there's one thing you can't accuse Aaron Finch of, it is selfishness. He will do whatever is best for the team including dropping himself. Langer and Ponting are backing him in. But it will become a concern if he can't get some runs.

David Warner and Aaron Finch beat the West Indies to the centre. Warner is taking strike to Oshane Thomas who has the new ball. Here we go. Two slips in.

10.26am The anthems are done. The players are about to head out to the middle.

Vasanth Babu K: "What national Anthem do they play for WI? Is it like a different anthem for every game for each country represented by the players or there is a standard anthem?" Rallaaaaaaay, Rally round the West Indies! One of the best anthems in world cricket.

10.20am The players are about to head out for the national anthems. In case you missed it, a huge story from George Dobell and Nagraj Gollapudi about AB de Villiers' offer to be available for South Africa in the World Cup.

Asif Nawaz: "Nathan Lyon would be a better choice in place of Coulter Nile. West Indies batting line is not very comfortable against Spin"

Shashi Seeram: "This is the record producing pitch so i felt WI should have backed themselves to put up a decent score..."

Kartik: "As much as everyone wants to see Windies batting stars go big, I think Aus bowlers, particularly Starc and Zampa, will be too skillful for them. By contrast, it will be difficult to contain Warner and co. who are in great form"

Varahan: "Lack of spinners in the WI team, makes it an easy choice for the WI should they win the toss. Given their team balance, they've made the right decision."

sharvari kulkar: "4 out of top 5 for Windies are lefties! Dont understand why Lyon isnt in the side!"

10.00am Toss - West Indies won the toss and will bowl first.

Jason Holder: "I think it's a good wicket and hopefully we can get some wickets early in the morning. I think it's just a matter for us to be disciplined. We've just got to be aggressive as we were in the first game and be smart as well. We've got one change Evin Lewis comes back in and Darren Bravo misses out. It's a tough choice. Evin is our main opener and we slot Nicholas in the middle."

Aaron Finch: "I probably would have a bat first anyway. It looks quite dry. Hopefully later on it starts to spin a bit. No changes, same team."

Teams - Australia: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey ((wk)), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa

West Indies: Chris Gayle, Evin Lewis, Shai Hope ((wk)), Nicholas Pooran, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder (c), Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite, Ashley Nurse, Sheldon Cottrell, Oshane Thomas

So one change for West Indies with Lewis back. Gayle and Russell are fit. Australia decided not to play Nathan Lyon even though the surface is dry.

Balashankar: "Unless the pitch has something to offer, it might be difficult for the Windies bowlers to contain the Aussie batsmen, but if there is much help from the pitch, the Aussie bowling attack could be deadly. Difficult proposition for the Windies today. Hoping against hope to see a Windies victory."

Imran Panjwani: "Is this a new pitch or same pitch on which Pakistan played England?" It is the same pitch they used for the England Pakistan match. Finch thinks it will slow up later on as it looks dry.

KARTIK KANTHETI: "Why is a guy like Shawn Marsh who had an amazing year in ODIs sitting out for Khawaja?? Or am I missing something here!!" Khawaja's recent form in the UAE series and the warm up games put him in front of Marsh, who's strike rate isn't quite as good as others in the line up. All four of his ODI centuries in the last 12 months came in losses and he scored at a slower rate than the opposition in three of them.

9.45am Will this be a bouncer barrage? Aaron Finch thinks it could be. Andre Russell hit Usman Khawaja in the head in a warm up game.

Brad Hodge thinks Australia's attack might given them an edge and Daren Ganga thinks West Indies batting will be tested.

ch satya: "Gayle storm is ready to launch..Get ready folks."

Chris Dunn: "Bouncer Barrage? No way, don't believe the re match hype, this will be a high scoring thriller (I hope)"

Udhai: "Hello from Nottingham! Beautiful sunny day, but cold, a perfect day for cricket! My colleague is there in Trent Bridge where I had to give it a miss for the work that has piled up :( will keep an eye on Cricinfo updates to ensure that i am not missing out! Look forward to a cracker of a contest!!"

9.30am Hello and welcome to Trent Bridge for this clash between Australia and West Indies. Both sides had comfortable wins to start the tournament. Today is a great opportunity for both teams to get a jump on the rest of the nations with two straight wins.

Alex Malcolm in commentary with you today along with Peter Della Penna. We are 30 minutes away from the toss. Here is Dan Brettig's preview. Chris Gayle and Andre Russell had some fitness queries this week but both should be available today.

Sean: "How's the weather guys?" Weather looks fine at the moment. Sun is out. But it is cold.

Dipanjan Show: "Australia last played West Indies on 26th June of 2016! After I started watching cricket, it will be the first time I will watch a match between Australia Vs West Indies." Quite incredible these two teams haven't played any ODI's in the last three years. There's not a lot of relevant recent data to go off in terms of the match ups today.

Avin: "Getting ready for the long weekend here in Adelaide, SA. While the winter is nippy bring it on Gayle vs Starc with hotness "
