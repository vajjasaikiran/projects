There's a long way to go, of course, and you'd say that SA were almost certainly the strongest of the losing sides in the first four games. That holds true if Australia defeat Afghanistan and possibly even if they don't."

Ferguson to Karunaratne, 1 run, outstanding from Santner at deep square! Or has he taken it cleanly? They're going upstairs. Not out comes the decision because replays inconclusive. The soft-signal was not-out too. Dimuth makes room to slap this but the bowler follows him, so now he decides to take on the short ball and pull, no timing and gets it high on the bat. Santner anticipates the stroke and runs in quickly and as this descends, put in a full-length dive to complete the catch. The on-field umpires went upstairs to check if this was a bump ball. They clearly felt there was some part of the ball touching the ground.

Henry to MDKJ Perera, OUT, miles and miles in the air, mid-off and mid-on briefly looked at each other but de Grandhomme calls finally and takes this superbly at mid-on. Went really high, looks like this full delivery held up just a touch more on the surface, Kusal looking to belt it down the ground but got hit a touch high on the bat, which is why there was no timing. Sri Lanka lose their second and it's a big wicket.

Rishav Chatterj: "I like the risk-free cricket being played right now with emphasis on the running between the wickets " -- Don't agree with the risk-free bit. Dimuth has had a couple of close shaves.

Henry to Thirimanne, OUT, huge appeal. I mean a really huge appeal. Plays all around a full delivery and is struck on the pad. Only doubt was did it pitch outside leg. . The answer is an emphatic no. Williamson goes for a review. Pitching in line, impact in line, hitting. Three reds, so he will have to walk back. What a review! Thirimanne is gone.

Henry to Thirimanne, FOUR runs, away with a leg glance! Easy pickings. Couldn't have asked for an easier first ball. Loose, down leg and he simply stands tall and tickles it fine.
Karunaratne and Thirimanne have a task at hand. To weather this storm with the new ball. On a green top. Can the openers get past the Henry-Boult spell? Two slips in place for Henry. Let's go

10.23am Sri Lanka's melodious anthem first up. It's the kind of comforting tune I'll need today. Thank you, Hemant. Hello everyone. The New Zealand anthem's done too and Williamson gives his boys a pep talk at the huddle as they run out onto the field.

"Cricket has its limitations. World Cup wins will do little to ease the suffering of families devastated by the blasts in Katuwapitiya and Kochchikade, or dull the profound grief of Batticaloa parents whose children were killed just as they were returning to the church building after Sunday school.

"But there is always the hope there will be some respite. Hope that Sri Lanka raise their game for a World Cup, as they often have done in this century, and that by some magic, a few wins can be strung together." -- This is just one small extract from this outstanding piece by Andrew Fidel Fernando

And with that I handover the duties to Shashank Kishore.

shahid: "BOULT WILL BE THE KEY" -- Yes, he will be. Took four wickets in each of the warm-up game.

Brett "Fish": "Are we going to see Pakistan II today? First close game of the World Cup? i don't see it that way. Think Sri Lanka are going to be thumped. And hoping against hope for Afghanistan later on... #GiantKillers"

You can watch our experts Daren Ganga, Murali Kartik, Daniel Vettori and Tillakaratne Dilshan discuss the toss and preview the game on our Match Day 
SK: "I disagree with one of the comments here about Thiri and Dimuth opening. We don't need to lose early wickets. If these two can see us through first ten overs, we (SL) will have "some" chance. "

Here are the playing XIs.
