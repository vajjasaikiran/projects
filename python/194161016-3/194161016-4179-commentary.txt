7.10pm: Right, it's been a blockbuster sort of day, with a damp squib ending. But we saw some great cricket, and now no team is unbeaten in the 2019 World Cup, which continues to rock and roll on its way. Join us tomorrow for the next match. Till then, on behalf of Alan Gardner, Andrew Miller and Chandn Duorah, this is Saurabh Somani signing off.

7.02pm: Before we close, let's give you what both captains said about those last five-six overs of India's chase, where Dhoni and Jadhav seemed happy to just knock the ball around rather than go for the target. S Rajesh has already pointed out that there were "7 dots, 20 singles, 3 fours, 1 six - in 31 balls". But that includes the last over, which India started with 44 needed and the match essentially over. When the game was alive, the tally was 5 dots, 18 singles, 2 fours in 25 balls. So here's how the two captains saw those last 5-6 overs.

Kohli: "It's up to discussions about the two guys in there. I think MS was trying really hard to get the boundary. They were just bowling good areas. We'll have to sit down and assess and improve in the next game."

Morgan: "It didn't really bother me to be honest, I was quite happy sitting back. But our bowlers bowled really well."

6.55pm:

Virat Kohli: "Look every team has lost a a game here and there. No one likes to lose but you have to accept the other side played better. The mood is absolutely same in the change room, we understand as professional cricketers it's a setback. (The toss) was vital, specially looking at the boundary that was quite short. I think it was 59 metres which coincidentally is the minimum amount required in an international match. Quite bizarre on a flat pitch. It's crazy that things fall in place like that randomly. But we should have been clinical because the wicket was flat. We could have accelerated and got closer to their total. If batsmen are able to reverse sweep you for six on a 59 metre boundary there is not much you can do. And one side was 82 metres. Look they had to be a bit smart in the lines they bowled, but you can't do much with a short boundary. I thought they were going towards 360 at one stage and we did quite well to pull them back. We could have restricted them more but Ben played a good innings. We were quite happy at the break. We thought if we get a start we can get it but that didn't happen, we still had a partnership. When Pant and Pandya were in there we thought we had a decent chance. But England were better on the day.

Eoin Morgan: "I thought we've had an outstanding day. Winning the toss and batting was an easy decision and it ended up working out. Jason Roy coming back in, Jonny going on and getting a hundred that wsa magnificent. The continuation of partnerships throughout took us to a good total. They are huge threats, the two main spinners for India, but them being taken on was great to see. It's the way we want to play our cricket. Throughout the innings the feedback was it got more difficult to bat on, it was getting more purchase off the deck, so I knew it wouldn't be easy.

Liam (Plunkett) has been outstanding for us the last four years. Particularly in that middle period, where it's difficult to take wickets. There is absolutely no (easy) game in this tournament. Every game in this world cup has been very tough and will continue to be.

George Dobell pings from Egbaston that India are getting booed. Not entirely unsurprising given how that final bit played out... Our stats editor S Rajesh tells me, "7 dots, 20 singles, 3 fours, 1 six - in 31 balls of the Dhoni-Jadhav partnership".


6.45pm: England's win tonight has put them on ten points with one game in hand. In turn, this has made the other semi-final contenders' task tougher. Here's what they need to do and hope in order to qualify for the knockouts:

Pakistan: Currently on nine points, they need to beat Bangladesh and hope England lose to New Zealand.

Bangladesh: They have seven points with two games in hand. But even beating India and Pakistan may not be enough. They will be rooting for NZ to beat England.

Sri Lanka: They are now out of the race for the top four.


Jonny Bairstow is the Man of the Match. "It was important to set up a platform. It's been frustrating a little bit for the guys, we know how well we can play. But today we were pretty good with bat, ball and in the field. But there's still things we can improve on against New Zealand. Having been at the IPL with VVS definitely helped (deal with spinners). The basic principles are the same. They bowled well upfront and the ball did a bit, a couple of inside edges went for fours. But you capitalise when you can. It was the closest to a complete performance we've had in the competition, but we also know we've got three must-win games in this World Cup up next."

6.40pm: Don't let that go-slow by India at the end fool you, this match deserved to be won by England. They were the better team. Bairstow and Roy bossed the early part, and Stokes played what for me was the best innings of the day. England might have left Buttler in the hut for too long but he made an impact nonetheless. And their bowlers were outstanding, bowled to a plan. Kohli and Rohit threatened, but ultimately was beyond them.

6.38pm: Well that was a maudlin sort of end to what had been a thrilling match for 90% of its duration. Both teams scored over 300, and this is the first time since 1992 that England have beaten India in a World Cup. Of course the sides from 1996 to 2015 were pretty bad at one-day cricket, putting it mildly. But this team isn't. They've played like a champion side today and won all the big moments. They've played bolder cricket and they are deserving winners. Their semifinal hopes are still alive. India's are very much alive too, though they'll want to dissect some stuff after this loss.

Sai: "Ah ..!! Here we go again .. What if these 2 started slogging and got out ..? They would again be blamed for not batting responsibly and not saving the NRR damage .. "

Abhishek: "Thats 30 minutes of my life I am never getting back. This is crazy. With 5 wickets in hand and two batsmen at the crease, its difficult to digest this kind of innings. No intent at all. A 315 All out is way better than 300/5. And getting just singles isnt the best way for NRR minimization. #Pathetic"

Apurv: "Doesn't this effort at the end by Dhoni means that Rohit's and Pandya's innings went in vain. No trying at all. I am so sad." - do remember that one more wicket and England are into the tail. So they can take risks, but only if the reward justifies the risk.

Shubham: "Run rate capitalization?? What the hell I just heard!! There are still 2 proper batsman on crease and if they can't go for victory I'm sorry, India aren't winning the WC" - Dhoni is pragmatic. If he thinks the target is beyond and going for it will result in foolhardiness, he bides his time and just takes the total closer. That's my reading at least

Plunkett to Pandya, OUT, caught by Vince at long-on and that should be the game? Pandya was frustrated into mis-timing that due to England's plans against him. This was on a length and around the fifth stump, he was moving across and didn't have the room to free his arms but aimed a big swipe anyway. Takes the top edge and swirls to long-on. That popping noise you hear is the sound of several countries' hopes being burst

Woakes to Pant, 1 run, reverse sweep, top edge, and safe! everything happened in that ball. Chuck those self-help books and watch Pant for insouciant confidence. Tries a reverse sweep off a length ball, it takes the top edge, bashes into his body and lobs up near point. Three fielders, including keeper and bowler, converging. But safe
36.2

Woakes to Pandya, 3 runs, cracked through the offside first ball. Short and outside off, he plays a horizontal bat slap through cover. Bairstow does excellently to tumble, slide and save the boundary, thrown in with some fancy footwork too
and expectedly, it's Hardik Pandya coming out. Ahead of Dhoni and Jadhav. Required rate is 10.12. Win probability down to 19.27

Woakes to Sharma, OUT, he's taken the big one first ball back What a return! Slower ball, off-cutter that he rolled fingers over. Rohit wanted to send it over cow corner, ends up edging behind.

Wood to Pant, FOUR runs, clears mid-off. He wasn't intending to go there, this is a pull shot over extra cover that goes for four. Was late on it, bounces up till his shoulder but he swipes it so hard that even with that kind of contact, he's standing almost parallel to the batsman - it carries over the in-field

On come the drinks, this contest is going the distance. Only one wicket during the middle phase, but what a big wicket it was... Rohit is still there, though, closing in on a significant landmark. Time for Saurabh again, and I suspect he's got a big finish in him

33.6
1
Wood to Pant, 1 run, fired across the bows, Pant plays it late again, slightly outside-edgey but the ball runs wide of Buttler... just one as third man comes across, to end an over of singles
"Chasing 330+ , short boundaries no sixes so far," notes JaiKumar. "England have bowled well ..so far"

Here's Dilip: "Eng made a smart move with inclusion of Plunkett. He did more than needed. Pricey wicket of master chase Batsman Virat back to pavilion. Victory sniffing for England." He's their middle-overs money-maker... That wicket could be the difference, though Rohit is now the danger man

This is calculated by taking the difference between the two totals that India will end up with: one, with Rohit batting on, and the other with Rohit getting out and being replaced by the other batsmen.

WATCH: Jonny Bairstow's sparkling 111. (India only)

Yash : "I don't know if many have realised, this score is almost the same as the tied match between these two nations in 2011. Also in 2011 India scored 268 against WI " - We've moved on from 1992 throwbacks to 2011 ones I see!

Mass: "I have been trying since last four years or so to get my comment published but always finishes at other end. Don't know how the comments are more special than mine which usually get going!!!. " - they all deposit a little something in a secret Swiss bank account. I'll be sending you the number soon...

Manohar: "Will Rahul be able to open the innings? He was off the field for most the innings I suppose.." - he can, because it's an external injury. Whether he'll be okay enough to or not, we'll know soon.

2.40pm: Thanks Alan. Well earned rest for your fingers after the Stokes-Buttler-Bumrah frenzy of that last stretch. What a ride!

2.25pm: England go brrrm brrrm in Brum, although a target of 338 is probably 30 runs shy of what India might have been facing had they not bowled so well in the 31-40 overs period. The openers tore it up, with Jonny Bairstow raising a defiant maiden World Cup hundred, only for India to hit back in the latter stages of the innings - Jasprit Bumrah was the good cop giving nothing away, while Mohammed Shami applied a shakedown at the other end, despite ending with the bruises to show for it. Had it not been for Ben Stokes providing the late humpty and hustle, England's total might have looked under par; whichever way you cut it, this will require India to pull off their highest World Cup chase. Anyway, time for Match Day crew to analyse things; Saurabh will be back to kick off the India innings shortly


WATCH - Jonny Bairstow's 111 (India only)

"This Match reminds me 2011 world cup knocks between two, let see how India responds to England total." Indeed, Prabhu, the old 338-338 game at Bangalore. Who fancies another tie?

"I had predicted 245 for Aus yesterday (and published thanks). Predicted 336-338 today when Eng were 155/0 (Not published for some reason) now I say Kohli gets a hundred and India wins in 48 overs. Does your predictor agree ??" Here's your moment, Ajay Dhanak. We'll have to wait for India to get going before Forecaster warms up

"You guys never tell us what time the next innings will starts and it hurts my feelings. What time am I supposed to set me alarm to?" You can sleep when you're dead, James J. Just stick some matchsticks under your eyelids and prepare for the long haul

Mohammed Shami to Stokes, 2 runs, shortish, slower ball, I think, Stokes' bottom hand comes off the bat as he carves through extra cover - needs a diving stop out on the rope, prevents a third this time; fifty up for Stokes, third in a row at this World Cup

And some encouragement for India, from Shiva: "In spite of that expensive 40th over by Yuzvendra Chahal, India have done well to restrict England. Out of the 47 instances in the last ten years when teams have been 180 or more for one or no wickets lost at the end of the 30th over, only once have oppositions managed to concede fewer runs from the next-10 overs. Against England, the lowest such ten-over score was 90/2 by Bangladesh earlier in this World Cup. India conceded just 43 today from 31 to 40."

Bounced out again, not a great look for the England captain, although he's a man who lives by the sword. Pushed across the batsman by Shami, got too big on him, never in control of the shot and Jadhav did really well running around from fine leg to take the catch diving forwards!

Hello, folks. Dracarys has been the order of the day at Edgbaston... but have India just landed their first Scorpion blow? Out comes Eoin Morgan, in his usual berth at No. 4

Sajan Nair points out that 24 of the last 40 balls were dots, which perhaps led to the wicket. On which note, please welcome Alan Gardner for his first stint today.

On a somewhat related note, there's some good news and bad news for Manchester United fans. The good news - Ole will be lifting the Premier League title next season, thanks to Pakistan. The bad news - England seem hell bent on ruining that fairy tale at the moment.

Mohammed Shami to Bairstow, OUT, caught at deep point! Shami will feel he has earned this wicket even though it's come off a very tame shot.

Satya: "I don't think Indians are bowling poorly. The pitch is flatter as compared to other matches in past week. Batting is England's strength and obviously this is their crucial match. The curator would favour the home side strength. The match is ON if we restrict anywhere less than 380. And, also master chaser Kohli is due for a big innings!!"

This was a bit of a top-spinner, Roy got to the pitch to cart it down the ground but didn't get the elevation. It still looked like a one bounce four until Jadeja came sprinting to his left, dived full length and plucked the ball inches from the ground. He's a wonder in the field is Jadeja, and it's needed that moment of outlandish brilliance to break this opening stand.

Keeping two spinners with no batting prowess and leaving behind Vijay Shankar on this featureless track. Even stronger case here was for Jadeja who inexplicably hasn't got any matches yet. " - Kohli did say Vijay had a toe niggle though.

Chahal to Bairstow, SIX runs, slam! five dot balls and Bairstow rocks back to smear this over wide long-on. No fielder there, and it just clears the rope. An over that was looking like it could hand back some control to India has ended up costing six runs - that's been England's batting today

Chahal to Bairstow, no run, googly, and he's not read it at all, goes back to slash it but it goes flat and spins back in to hit him on the pads. Easily going down leg, despite the excitable (and understandable) appeal

Nitin Sharma: "Kohli shouldn't have removed Shami. He was almost about to get Bairstow's wicket. There is still merit in bringing him back. He should think wickets not runs" - on a flat pitch, given this England batting line-up, you have to think of both.

Roshy: "One thing Ind and Aus haven't done quite often and successfully in this WC is chasing big totals and this might be the last chance for Ind!!" - certainly looks like they'll have the chance to do that!

Time for Miller to take a breather. This England assault will leave most breathless to be honest. And Forecaster has zoomed to 356.

Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, jeepers, that's a tight leave! Bending inexorably towards the top of off, Roy holds his bat inside the line and it was length more than anything that was the deciding factor

Mohammed Shami to Roy, no run, squared up a touch on a leg-stump line once more, angling in from middle-and-leg, and Roy topples forward in an emphatic block

Mohammed Shami to Roy, FOUR runs, shorter, wider, chopped fiercely past point! That's how Roy likes to roll, emphatic forearms, powered through the ball, and the fielder has no chance!

Mohammed Shami to Roy, 1 wide, sharp pace, but swinging down the leg side. England are off the mark as Roy attempts a flick but can't time it
10.27am Thanks Sourabh. Scene on hai? You better believe it! England's favourite opening partnership, Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, are reunited in the middle, Mohammad Shami has the new ball. Let's play some cricket!

And it's back to Andrew Miller for the start of this blockbuster.

10.24am: National anthems time.

Vinay Patodia: "I feel Pant was taken as batsman replacement for Dhawan; whereas Kartik was taken as second wicketkeeper batsman for replacement for Dhoni, in case he is not playing. So Pant - DK comparison does not make sense to me ...."

10.18am: Pakistan have their 1992 parallels, England have been talking about the Cup coming home for a while now, Australia are Australia. Through all of it, India have quietly got to the doorsteps of the semi-final, (almost) without putting a foot wrong so far. Is it their World Cup to lose now? Our latest Talking World Cup podcast has more (and it's also on Apple Podcasts)

yash: "Hello CRICINFO, What does your WIN PREDICTOR say before the start of the match?" - it says that the side that plays better cricket will win :)

Girish: "Just noticed that kohli said Vijay Shankar has toe niggle. Did that mean Rishab Pant came as a replacement only and Vijay is not dropped." - Apparently so.

"I don't think there is any additional pressure on the Indian spinners. They've both been bowling really well. And whether you have an additional bowler or not, you still have to go out and bowl those 10 overs. Only if there is an injury will you be challenged (with one less bowler)" - Sachin Tendulkar has spoken. He's also said, "The ball will be flying. The batters will be smiling. For sure 315-plus wicket." (Or did he say 350-plus?). He's still a batsman is Sachin, because he couldn't suppress a smile when he said the ball would be flying.

HenryS: "Anyone else noticed that England have only lost when chasing? Bodes well for today..." - yep, yep.

10.14am: What do you make of Pant's entry: yay or nay? Go and vote in our #livereport

So that's 3/3 for ESPNcricinfo's pre-game predictions about team changes. Jason Roy and Liam Plunkett in for James Vince and Moeen Ali. And Rishabh Pant in for Vijay Shankar. The excitement, it's a-tingling.

Abhinav Kashika: "Rishabh Pant shouldn't open and come in at number 4. KL Rahul has been steady with the bat at opening and should continue opening for this tournament. Pant is a solid inclusion for number 4. I believe they could have included Bhuvneshwar replacing Kuldeep." - I believe Bhuvneshwar isn't at 100% yet.

Maqbool KK: "with inclusion of J Roy England is a different batting side. It is more like India with Dhawan!!!"

BharatD: "I feel for DK. He has been part of the original squad. But instead the team chose Pant who came in as a replacement." - bit of a tactical call too, due to Pant being a left-hander. Though yes, it must be hard on Dinesh Karthik.

10.02 am: England win the toss and bat first.

England: 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler ((wk)), 7 Chris Woakes, 8 Liam Plunkett, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood

India: 1 Rohit Sharma, 2 KL Rahul, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 Rishabh Pant, 5 MS Dhoni ((wk)), 6 Kedar Jadhav, 7 Hardik Pandya, 8 Kuldeep Yadav, 9 Mohammed Shami, 10 Yuzvendra Chahal, 11 Jasprit Bumrah

Eoin Morgan: It's a matter of two games, hopefully we'll win the two games and go through. Tough challenge against India. (Plunkett inclusion) is more tactical. The wicket looks good, doesn't look like it'll turn much. (Jason Roy) is not a big risk. He's trained well and he's fit to play. It is a test of our character. We spoke as a group, rejigged and reset what we're trying to do.

Virat Kohli: Never a problem, love chasing. But honestly, would have batted first as well. We haven't chased after the first game, so it's a good challenge for us. We might have looked to do that in the last couple of games anyway. We haven't really focused on the opposition till now in the tournament. We've been finding ways to win games, that's the biggest positive for us. Vijay Shankar has a bit of a toe niggle, Rishabh Pant comes in for him. We've all seen what he can do with the bat. He'll bring a lot of flair and fearlessness, once he gets going, he's difficult to stop. There's one short boundary as well. Crunch result on the outside as well, so I'm sure the fans of the Pakistan team will be supporting us today!

Toss coming up soon. Virat Kohli will be in the spiffy new 'away' jersey that India have unveiled for this World Cup. - as Shahbaz says : "Being SRH fan feel good about India's New Kit. Go Orange!!!!!!!!"

Confirmed, that Vijay Shankar is not in the XI. And Rishabh Pant is in.

Sumit Goenka: "I have a sneaky feeling that India might open with Pant and push KL Rahul down to No. 4."

Tabrez: "Whatever the result is, I'm just hoping for a repetition of yesterday's match between Pak & Afg. All the high profile games in this tournament have failed to live up to the expectations so far. Hope this one changes it"

Sanketp45: "England is pretty good side we all know this but this game is about handling the pressure. May be more than playing in the final they are pressurised to win this one to get qualify. They started this tournament as favourite nd now their qualifying is at stake"


9.50am: Isa Guha says the weather's set fair, so a good day of cricket. One side of the boundary, square is just 59 metres, so people might be targeting that. Sanjay Manjrekar says it's a fresh pitch, so it might not be helping spinners as much as it did during Pakistan v New Zealand. "This pitch is completely covered by grass, dry grass. Slight turn first up and more turn as the sun comes up. Bat first," he says.


Variety of opinions on Pant's inclusion:

Shashwat: "playing Pant and all is fine but where are you going to hide him in the field is the main problem I feel!!"

Paramjit Singh: "On one hand everyone says that Kohli keeps his winning side unchanged and on the other he replaces Vijay Shankar. I totally agree with KP that Vijay is a potential match winner. Now imagine Rohit being dropped in initial stages of his career. Would we have seen 3 double centuries being scored???"

Puneet: "He will hit you for a six, he will babysit your kids. He is Rishabh Pant. "

yogesh: "Why Pant not dinesh kartik ? Why kartik is so underestimated ? He is an experienced lad."


How would Rishabh Pant fit into India's XI? Here's a primer.

9.36am: The big news we're hearing right now is that Rishabh Pant is going to replace Vijay Shankar in the Indian XI. Nagraj Gollapudi, who has eyes and ears everywhere and who is at Edgbaston right now, says, "Pant was batting for long ,especially against spin, during training yesterday. Clearly to blunt Rashid."

Kevin Pietersen and Virat Kohli were seen having a long-ish chat on the field. Still an hour to go for the match, and half hour to go for the match. And both men seemed quite intense. "I never asked him about what's happening today, I was just talking to him about life and about London," KP says.

We're also wondering if KP brought this up:

@KP24
 Dear Virat & Ravi - please don’t drop Vijay Shankar. 
I think he’s coming into his own and would potentially win you tomorrow’s game. 
Don’t think about Pant. He needs another 3 weeks prep before I think he can get into your World Cup side. 

Thanks, boys!

9.30am: Proper scenes today, thanks much Miller. But me being over-excited is a rumour. I did *not* myself offer to come in half hour early (and then reached 45 mins in advance), and I did *not* think of Rohit Sharma's pull shot in the last 24 hours at all. I most certainly did not dream of Jofra Archer bowling a sustained spell to Virat Kohli.

9.26am Abhinav: "Today, I expect the entire sub-continent will be rooting for India...the streets of Lahore, Karachi, Dhaka, Khulna and Colombo would be cheering for the Men in Orange today...it's like a clash of civilisations all over again, ain't it? And please publish my comment fair Sirs of ESPNCricinfo." Something like that. It is all jolly exciting either way!

And on that note, I am going to hand over to Saurabh Somani, who is every bit as over-excited as I am ...

McEnroe : "I love how you had an early start to the coverage, yet there were Cricinfo-nites ready to start sending in their comments anyway! Long live the Cricinfo Coverage and long live England!"

9.23am Now then, now then ... George pings with his assertion that Liam Plunkett is in for Moeen Ali. That's a big call, and a bold one as well. Plunkett hasn't played in each of England's three losses to date, but his habit of forcing wickets in the middle overs is undiminished. Can he find a way through to that under-tested India middle order?

9.19am Kamil Khan: "Why there is no update on the weather forecast?" There was a brief nod to the weather earlier. It will be hot and dry, don't you worry. Though potentially not a scorcher, unlike yesterday.

Santosh Battula: "England should literally squeeze an ORANGE today if they want to avoid having the BLUES." Ah yes, a splendidly cryptic way of reminding me that India will be wearing their change kit today, to avoid a clash with England's ... err... not remotely similar light blue jersey. But if England do manage to squeeze the orange shirts, they will no doubt bleed blue anyway ...

9.15am As for India, team news when we get it, although an unchanged XI seemed likely as of yesterday. Might there be a temptation to get that old adversary, R Jadeja, back into the mix, however? As England discovered when Nathan Lyon was pitched in against them by Australia at Lord's last week, sometimes players with a history against certain sides bring an extra threat.

Kalpesh Z agrees with me, up to a point: "India should bring in Jaddu in place of Kedar. He will surely help in two departments out of three. Andrew may say "why fix something which is not broken?" But why should we wait till something breaks. Precaution is always better than cure!" Nope, I am all for smashing things up!

9.12am An early insight into the team news .. George Dobell has got his binoculars out and is studying the body language and bowling methods. "Pretty sure Moeen is not playing," he says... which would be a bit call, but understandable in the context of a tournament in which he has been way short of his best, particularly with the bat. "Jofra Archer is bowling legbreaks now," he adds. Gosh, well, get him in the team any which way you can ... yep, Archer is playing, George confirms.

9.08am Sreedhar : "Never been so early into cricinfo, and never been so calm about India's match in a world cup! Would take both win and loose with a pint of beer.. jeete to Pakistan bahar, haare to England bahar.. what happens if it's a tie ?? Please post my comment at least today , finger crossed " A tie, between England and India at a World Cup? Unthinkable! But that, to be fair, would be better than nothing for England - drawing them back level with Pakistan on nine points with one to play, and with a better NRR too...

9.05am sameer ur rehma: "What if NZ loses their next game? They will have 11 Points and If Pakistan Wins again BD, They will have 11 too and If Eng wins their both games, so which team will go to semi? NZ or Pak?" It will all come down to the dreaded Net Run Rate. We calculated that a scenario of Pakistan beating Bangladesh by 70-80 runs and England beating New Zealand by about 50 would tip the scales in Pakistan's favour. It's still a long shot, and it doesn't change England's requirement at all. Two wins is the realistic minimum if they want to stay alive.

8.57am What of India's status going into this game then? Our Dear Leader, Sambit Bal, has been up in Birmingham, sampling the scene, and reports back on a squad that has make stately progress in the tournament without yet being tested to the extent of other sides. Will that day come today, against the pre-tournament favourites, and if so, will their untested middle-order stand up to scrutiny?

Usman Cheema: "Come on India you have to win today... Lots of love and HUGE support from your Neighbors today...(being political here)" It wouldn't say it's political, I'd call it pragmatic! Yes, this is a contest that has the power to unite the subcontinent, with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka all primed to feel the benefits if their mighty neighbour can do them a favour today. With Bangladesh and Pakistan set to play each other last, England know that a loss today takes the permutations out of their hands... and despite losing to South Africa in their own crunch game, Sri Lanka have a mathematical chance if other results go their way.

8.54am So, most importantly of all ... what are the conditions going to be like? Well, it's been a scorcher for the past couple of days, which is as close to good news as England could have hoped for in the circumstances. The Edgbaston pitch looks a belter, devoid of the juice that has been making some of the decks in this tournament more lively than England had bargained for, but perhaps without the extravagant spin that would play so clearly into the hands of Kuldeep Yadav and co.

"It's dry and warm in Edgbaston," says George Dobell. "Though nowhere near as hot as yesterday. A bit overcast at present..."

8.51am Stewart Cooper: "Jeepers early start! All or nothing for England today. Get Roy back and let's look to dominate this Indian attack. MasterBlasting from England or another limp World Cup exit looms ..."

That would appear to be the long and the short of it. Roy is sure to play ... he was moving freely during England's practice yesterday, and as George Dobell pointed out in his preview, England are prepared to risk his fitness - and that of Jofra Archer, who was another worryingly limited presence - to get their campaign back on track. They have missed his calm and class at the top of the order like nothing else.

8.40am Good morning and welcome to Edgbaston's Day of Reckoning. It's England v India. It. Is. Massive ... It is ON.

Priyo Bhuiyan: "Is the game gonna start early? Why does today cricinfo start early " Because it is the most important match of the tournament so far, and we are all far too excited to do anything but get to work and start typing!

So, in summary ... this is a battle of the current No.1s versus the former No.1s. The current World Cup favourites versus the former World Cup favourites. The team that has steamrollered all before them this tournament, versus the team that had been steamrollering all before them before this tournament.

India are in a mood of serene dominance, sitting pretty in the table, with points on the board and games in hand with which to guarantee their semi-final slot. England are in a state of advanced funk ... pushed to the brink of yet another early exit by an error-strewn campaign, and now facing four must-win games out of four if they are to lift that elusive trophy for the first time in their history. If ever there was a day to focus the minds and remember the methods that have transformed perceptions about England's white-ball cricket, it is now. But of all the teams to have to do it against? The toss is at 10am. We'll be bringing all the build-up between now and then.
