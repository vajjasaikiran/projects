Zampa to Liton Das, OUT, Given LBW!. Liton reviews after a chat with Mushfiqur. He was caught on the crease and trapped by one that slid on quickly. He went back to a good length ball but it zipped off the surface and hit him on the knee roll. No bat involved and it's not going over. Only question is whether it's sliding down leg. No it's hitting! It was 'Umpire's call' hitting enough of leg stump! Decision stands. Bangladesh keep their review.

Earthman : "Bangladesh chased down 322 in 42.5 overs the other day. Around 375-380 in 50 overs, in a batting paradise like this, is not impossible. Even if the opposition is the Aussies. "

The cover are coming off. Play will resume in 10 minutes.

WATCH - Khawaja falls 11 short of century (Australia, UK, SEA only)

WATCH - Did Steven Smith waste a review? See his lbw and have your say (Australia, UK, SEA only)

Bangladesh will have to chase 377 from 49 overs in case but the delay would need to be 75 minutes long for us to lose overs. The full square covers are on. But there's some blue sky in the distance so hopefully it's a short delay.

Hasnain: "My Bangladeshi roommate is praying for rain not to stop until the match gets abandoned:)"

Ashish: "Never thought that Australia would reach 400. Then Maxi came and I was like easily 400 would be breached. Then Maxi goes and now it looks like 400 is Mt Visuvius now!"

If you think Australia have been dominant today, check out what happened elsewhere in the cricket world: Uganda women beat Mali women by a whopping 304 runs - in a T20I.

2.09pm Match delay The rain has gotten heavier and the umpire's have sent the players off. The covers are coming on. This rain is heavy. Fans are putting umbrellas up or heading for shelter. It's pretty dark too. Hopefully it's only a short burst.
