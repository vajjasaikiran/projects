Vijit : "I am unable to understand this strategy of Finch of allowing the new batsman to settle by bowling Maxwell upfront. It's more like underestimating your opponent, could well be a game-changing decision too." He's a good match up to the two left handers and he has to get 10 overs out of him. He should have had Dimuth. If you leave it later then the right handers like Mendis and Mathews could climb into Maxwell.

Gorsi: "Alex, why when a batsman becomes captain, always becomes more careful. They should be taking the same responsibility even when they are not captaining the side. Look at Dimuth, who knew him before the WC, and now he is leading the charge against one of the dangerous bowling attack." Some men rise with the responsibility. It sharpens their focus. Also gives them a greater purpose than their individual score.

Richardson to Karunaratne, no run, sways out of the way of this short ball, excellent delivery

Monga's musings from The Oval: Sri Lanka have had a great start, getting the better of all the four quicks from Australia, but they also seem to have enjoyed more than a bit of luck. Apart from the edges etc, just look at the control factor. When Australia batted they were in control of 90% of the deliveries in the first 10 overs. Sri Lanka have controlled only 65%. However, when Australia were in control they scored at under a run a ball. Sri Lanka have gone almost twice of that rate in deliveries they have been in control of. The message is clear: Sri Lanka have less to lose in this match, and they are going all out, taking more risks. And with every single and double - forget boundaries - the crowd is getting more and more into this game. During the first half it seemed there were only a few Sri Lanka supporters in the crowd, but they have found their voice now.

They need change their names for the scorecard and jerseys - pronto!" -- Don't agree with the 'half-decent' tag for Samaraweera. He was an excellent Test batsman

Srinath: "Needless to say Sri Lanka need some good partnerships and a LOT of luck going their way to win this one! If they sustain this for 20 overs they will be over the DLS par score. Hope this game lasts that long." -- Fact that not many believe SL can do it if the game lasts the distance tells you a story of their decline.

2.40pm Thank you, Alex. Welcome back. We are minutes away from Sri Lanka's chase. If you need to know, "Karunaratne is a massive Starc bunny in Tests," Fidel informs me from Cardiff (He's away at Afghanistan v South Africa). He got him five out of the six times (all cheaply) in the 2016 Test series. Two out of three times in the series this year. Let's see how Sri Lanka's captain will respond against his nemesis. Kusal Perera walks out to open with him. This should be fun. It's pretty dark and the flood lights are taking effect at The Oval.

Pradeep to Finch, FOUR runs, a pure straight drive down the ground! He did this with such ease. It was slightly over-pitched and he just leaned forward, eased the bat through the line and it went straight past the stumps to the sightscreen

The Australian openers Aaron Finch and David Warner are on their way out to the middle to join the Sri Lankan players. Warner will be on strike. Lasith Malinga has a new ball. He low fived Finch. Sid Monga says there was boos for Warner. There were none in the last game.

10.25am Both teams are out there for anthem. The Oval is bathed in sunshine! What a sight!

Sudarshana Band: "Actually a green pitch is a blessing in disguise for SL. SL fast bowling strength is swing and seaming,not the pace. None of them are 140kph. If they can make early inroads, and pass top 3, Aus middle order is not the strongest recently. Dimuth won an important toss, if his pacers could take the advantages. If SL can keep Aus below 300(preferrably 250), SL has a big chance."

10.10am Tune into the pre game Live Show.

Lasan Rashmika: "Before the match all of us thought SL will play 2 leg spinners Jeevan and Vendersey to tackle Aussies. Now there is not even 1 leg spinner in the playing XI"

There's no leg spinner in either team. There is clearly an expectation that it will seam around at the Oval today.

NMS: "Is it "RAINY" today?" No rain at the moment.

10.00am Toss Sri Lanka won the toss and will bowl first.

Dimuth Karunaratne: "With the last few days rain we want to take advantage of the conditions. (Nuwan) is fit. He bowled and fielded well in practice and is fit. Suranga Lakmal is not playing. Siriwardana comes in. We've trained harder and harder during the break."

Aaron Finch: "I would have bowled first. With a bit of over head clouds I think it might swing around first thing this morning so we're going to have to bat well. We haven't put it all together yet but we're building nicely. When you look down our list we've got a lot of experience there. We're going to have to be careful early and disciplined against the new ball. One change, Nathan Coulter-Nile is a bit stiff and Jason Behrendorff comes in."

Teams Australia: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Alex Carey ((wk)), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jason Behrendorff, Kane Richardson

Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Perera ((wk)), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Milinda Siriwardana, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith Malinga

Jimmy: "Absolutely gobsmacked Lyon still can't get a game"

Adarsh: "It is surprising that Sri Lanka are complaining about green wickets. Their squad is full of bowlers who do well on seaming wickets and who might struggle on flat decks. They were able to come back from a losing position against Afghanistan only because the green pitch offered sideways seam movement."

9.45am The toss is 15 minutes away. Marcus Stoinis is still unavailable today. Australia are hopeful of testing him during the week ahead of the Bangladesh game on Thursday. Mitch Marsh has joined the squad but he cannot play unless Stoinis is ruled out of the tournament.

Sri Lanka are hoping Nuwan Pradeep is fit after suffering a finger injury at training.

ShivG 420: "Alex, what do you think is the ideal batting order for Aus with Smith, Khawaja and Marsh playing together?" Great question. I don't know. I think they can go a number of ways. One of the major issues is Khawaja had never batted outside the top 3 in his ODI career. But the openers are set and Smith, in my opinion, is the best number 3. So it looks like it will be Marsh/Khawaja at 4/5 and they may slide further if Maxwell is promoted.

Padre Joseph : "Bring in Lyon for the SL lefthanders." Wouldn't be surprised. He bowled beautifully in the warm up game against them.

Dahaln: "@icc..green wickets..only for @OfficialSLC..what do u guys say about this.." They might not be happy about today's surface. I haven't seen it yet but reports are there is grass on it. It is fresh.

Sandaru Herath: "This will be a huge test for the Sri Lankan middle order.Even though the openers have done reasonably well, the middle order of Mendis,Mathews and Dhananjaya haven't done anything to justify their positions.I wont be surprised if Sri Lanka drop one of Dhananjaya or Mendis and bring in Siriwardene!"

9.30am Hello and welcome to the Oval for this clash between Australia and Sri Lanka. These two sides met in the warm up games and Australia were too good.

Sri Lanka have had their campaign halted by rain. Hopefully it stays away today. Australia have three wins and would hope to keep the momentum rolling.

Here is Daniel Brettig's preview. Alex Malcolm and Shashank Kishore will be in commentary with you today.

Sri Lanka have been upset about the pitches and training facilities they have had to deal with so far in this World Cup.

It's a fresh pitch today. There is anticipation that it will have some pace in it.

Sidharth Monga has noted that Australia are trying to find perfection.

Pete Lowe: "What is the weather like? It's dark and wet down under. " Looks OK at the moment. Fingers crossed it stays that way.

Ashish Kachhawa: "So far Zing bails leading with 5 wins followed by rain with 4 wins. Let's see what is in store today."
