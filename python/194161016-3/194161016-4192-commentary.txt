7.07pm Thanks, Deiva. So... the Super Over. England will bat first. The teams have only two wickets each. And what happens if we get another tie now? the team that has hit more boundaries in their innings and the Super Over will win.

Who will New Zealand nominate as their bowler? Boult? Right after he's finished the most draining of final overs? Lockie Ferguson, with his changes of pace? The New Zealand players are gathered in a circle, and all kinds of deliberations must be going on. They look pretty calm, though.

England have nominated Stokes and Buttler as their two openers. It's Trent Boult to bowl. Neither of these three players deserves to be on the losing team. Neither team deserves to be the losing team. But we must have a winner. A World Cup winner. Here we go.

7.03pm CRAZY SCENES at Lord's. We will have a Super Over shootout to decide the winner. Karthik Krishnaswamy is back to close it out for good

W
Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, Holy Moly! It's a freaking tie. We're not done yet. We will have a Super Over to decide the winner of the 2019 World Cup. This is a full-toss on middle, Boult searches for the yorker, but can't get it right, hacked down to long-on. The fielder hares in, gathers the ball. Stokes tears back for the second, Wood dishes out a desperate full-length dive, but the throw is to the bowler's end and Wood is caught metres short
MA Wood run out (Neesham/Boult) 0 (3m 0b 0x4 0x6)

Okay, it's down to 2 off 1 ball. Breathe

49.5
W
Boult to Stokes, 1 run, OUT, middle-stump yorker, Stokes backs away outside leg and stabs it down to long-off. Santner hunts down the ball at long-off and throws it to Boult, who takes the bails off in ice-cool fashion. Stokes had to go for the second, he had to be on strike, but Rashid is caught short by a long way. Gone for a duck without facing a ball
AU Rashid run out (Santner/Boult) 0 (7m 0b 0x4 0x6)

England need 3 off 2 balls. Williamson chats with Boult, he is slowing things down

49.4
6
Boult to Stokes, 6 runs, It's all happening at Lord's. Full-toss on middle, smeared away to deep midwicket. Guptill attacks the ball and sets himself up for a direct hit. It might have well been a direct hit had Stokes not inadvertently deflected it away with his outstretched bat, diving forward to save himself from being run-out. The deflection ensures the ball tickles away to the boundary. It's six runs in the end. Wouldya believe it? It's ridiculous
49.3
6
Boult to Stokes, SIX runs, Whacked over midwicket. Lord's raises itself to a massive roar. Boult ditches the yorker. Slower ball, full and outside off, in the slot. Stokes drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over midwicket
49.2
0
Boult to Stokes, no run, mighty full and outside off, not quite a perfect yorker, jabbed more or less straight to Williamson at extra-cover
49.1
0
Boult to Stokes, no run, yorker just outside off, jabbed to the left of extra-cover. Stokes keeps the strike as Williamson swoops down on the ball

Neesham to Archer, OUT, Archer bags a first-ball duck in the final. Pressure can make you do strange things. Another legcutter variation, full on middle, Archer does not spot it. He swings for the hills, deflects this slower ball off the pad onto the stumps

48.4
6
Neesham to Stokes, SIX runs, Is that six? Yes it is! Crazy scenes at Lord's. Boult nearly pulls off a hokey-pokey catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary. He catches the ball near the boundary, but well the momentum takes his over the ad boards. His foot is on the ad board as he relays the ball to Guptill. Fine margins. It could have been a match-winning catch. Instead, it's a six. Stokes manufactures some swinging room, full on the stumps, Stokes belts it in the air...
England need 22 off nine balls. Here comes Jofra Archer

48.3
W
Neesham to Plunkett, OUT, Legcutter from Neesham, 114ks, Plunkett aims to launch it over long-off. Nope, he can't clear Boult at the boundary. This was full and outside off, Plunkett got underneath it and swung it in the air... but was done in by the lack of pace

Ferguson to Woakes, OUT, Two in two for Ferguson! Is this the game? Banged in short on off stump, rushes Woakes for pace, and draws a top-edge as the batsman sets up for a hook. The ball drops from the London skies, a nervous Latham makes a fairly simple catch looks difficult. He keeps his eyes on the ball and clings onto it in the end

Ferguson to Buttler, OUT, It's that man Lockie Ferguson who breaks the stand and the game open for New Zealand. Buttler holes out to Southee, the sub, at sweeper cover. Slower variation once again from Ferguson, 123ks, full and outside off. He asks Buttler to manufacture the pace for himself. Buttler just skews it in the air. Southee initially misjudged the flight of the ball. He moved to his left, then to his right, then sprinted in to grab a pressure catch sliding on his knees

Cheers, KK. England need 105 off 16 overs. Are we in for a blockbuster finish to the 2019 World Cup? Stokes and Buttler have rallied England with a busy, unbroken fifty stand. Can Santner break it?


kunal: "Seems... Santner, Neesham and Ferguson will be doing bulk of bowling in majority of death overs"


Ammar: "NZ need CdG to bowl 15 overs if they are to win today .. Boult & Henry dont seem to be getting much assistance from the wicket in their 2nd spells .."

Henry to Stokes, no run, ooh. Back of a length, angling into off stump. Looks to work it with the angle into the leg side, closes his bat face early, and pops a leading edge back towards the bowler. Doesn't carry to him, though, despite a dive forward

This spell could well be on the same lines as the one Amarnath bowled in the 1983 final." -- CdG is a lot quicker than Amarnath. Or even the classic New Zealand dibbly-dobblers he gets compared to. CdG is not a Gavin Larsen or Chris Harris. He's more like Dion Nash, a genuine new-ball bowler if there's swing.

Wide length ball, carved away in the air, and Lockie sprints in from the boundary, throws himself forward, and grabs it two-handed, perfectly clean, a couple of inches off the ground. The soft signal was out, but the soft signal doesn't matter at all, because the replays were so conclusive. We've seen some outstanding catches at this World Cup. This is among the top three. Or four. Or five. Or one.

Greeshmanth: "Am i missing something or Santner didn't start to bowl" -- Good question. I wonder if the two left-handers in the middle are making Williamson delay his introduction. He has other options anyway. Here's Jimmy Neesham, over the wicket to Morgan.

Ajay: "@Newistan Stokes can do all what Jaddu can do today, except the sword rotating celebration after 50 ;)"

Pranav Nigadkar: "Ben Stokes will be the key in England's chase here, He has already shown us in this tournament against Sri Lanka and Australia that he can bat deep in such tricky situations, but both of his innings ended up in a losing cause. Today is his his chance to right the wrong in the best possible way at the World Cup finals!!"

de Grandhomme to Morgan, 2 runs, down the track and CdG floats a slower ball wide of off stump. Reaches out to try and launch it over mid-off, doesn't middle it, and it lands juust beyond Williamson's reach as he turns around and gives chase
Kiran Bhanushal: "The ball from CdG to get Root was at best an average delivery. But the cricketing sense from CdG to float a juicy away swinging half volley at that precise point to tempt Root was cricketing sense at its finest. 29 balls for 7 runs, under pressure to feel ball on bat, swung wildly the previous ball. As an allrounder CdG must have smelled that desperate feeling on Root!"

Boult to Roy, no run, gone first ball? No? Marais Erasmus doesn't think it's out, but that looked pretty close, and New Zealand have reviewed... It's the trademark Boult inswinger from left-arm over, past Roy's attempt at a straight-bat drive to mid-on. No inside edge... Pitching on around middle stump, and it's umpire's call on leg stump! Roy survives. Just. What saved him, I think, was that he was playing with a straight bat. If he'd gone further across with his front leg and played across it, the umpire might have been more inclined to give it out
3.10pm We're back. England need 242 to wrap their hands around the World Cup trophy for the first time. If New Zealand can stop them from getting there, they become first-time champions. Trent Boult has the first new ball, and the barnstorming opening pair of Roy and Bairstow, Boy and Rairstow, are in the middle. Just one slip in place for Boult, and a short, catching square leg for the uppish flick off the inswinger. Interesting.

WATCH on Hotstar (India only): How the New Zealand wickets fell

WATCH on Hotstar (India only): Henry Nicholls scores a gritty half-century

Quite apart from this World Cup final, there is plenty of unmissable sporting action going on elsewhere this Super Sunday. Why not follow the latest from the British Grand Prix at Silverstone or Federer vs Djokovic in the Wimbledon final?

Tahir Abbas: "The outcome of this game relies heavily on the first spells of Boult, Henry and Ferguson. If they have a say, its game on with this score."

Mahota: "The hell you cannot blame Santner for leaving this last one. He at least should have tried." -- Try facing a 110kph slower bouncer from a 145kph bowler with a highly deceptive action, and tell me if you pick every pace and length variation. It was a damn good ball, and most of batting is instinctive reaction, and that was what happened with Santner.

Lakshitha: "In the 1996 world cup final, Australia scored 241 against Sri Lanka, and the Lankans went onto chase that down with ease..."

Liam Plunkett: "It's a good pitch. We thought we bowled tight lines to restrict New Zealand. Try and get as much out of the pitch with my variations. That's my role. I use the cross-seam ball more than the seam-up."

2.43pm Well, then. Started out as a greentop, and then it slowed down considerably. There was movement off the pitch throughout for the bowlers who hit the deck, and the slower balls gripped and did unpredictable things. England's romp in their semi-final might suggest they're overwhelming favourites to chase this down, but I have a feeling it won't be as easy as that on this pitch. None of the New Zealand batsmen really looked fluent today, and England might have a scrap on their hands too.

Archer to Santner, no run, ha. Kind of sums up the latter half of New Zealand's innings, this ball. Santner ducks under a slower bouncer over leg stump. Then he thinks of stealing a bye and decides against it. Archer is just so deceptive, you can't blame Santner for it
49.5
1
Archer to Boult, 1 run, looks to make room again and Archer follows him with a blockhole ball. Jabbed to mid-off
49.4
0
Archer to Boult, no run, slower yorker, angling into middle and leg. Looks to make room, can't find any, stabs it back to the bowler
Speaking of 1992 comparisons, can New Zealand get to Pakistan's total of 249?

49.3
W
Archer to Henry, OUT, top of off. Well, usually fast bowlers look to hit top of off on the bounce, and Archer's simply hit it on the full. Looks to clear his front leg and slog it away, but can't put bat to ball
MJ Henry b Archer 4 (7m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00

49.3

Archer to Henry, 1 wide, slower bouncer, and Henry misses the attempted tennis-swat over square leg. Wided for height
49.2
1
Archer to Santner, 1 run, in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and stabs to extra-cover. Another risky single - they have to take all of them - and another failure to hit the stumps. Santner has to slide home, and he may have hurt himself in the process. Seemed a little worse for the wear initially, but he looks okay
49.1
0
Archer to Santner, no run, slower bouncer over leg stump. Shuffles across and looks to hoick it towards fine leg, misses

Woakes to Henry, FOUR runs, boom! A rare ball in the slot, angling into off stump, and he clears his front leg and wallops it over midwicket, one bounce and over the rope. Most of England's other 'full' balls have been off-pace, and/or too full to get underneath
Matt Henry's on strike now, for the first time.

48.5
1
Woakes to Santner, 1 run, full, close to off stump, driven along the ground to mid-off and they chance the quick single. A direct hit from Wood could have had Santner in trouble at the non-striker's end
48.4
0
Woakes to Santner, no run, another slower ball, full and angling away from off stump. Santner swings early, looking to slog over midwicket, and misses
Free-hit.

48.4
1nb
Woakes to Santner, 1 no ball, whoops, high full-toss, and Woakes will get a warning for this. Slanting across the left-hander, ends up hitting Santner's left shoulder as he aims to swat it away into the leg side
48.3
W
Woakes to Latham, OUT, gone, a third wicket for Woakes. England haven't allowed the lofted hits over mid-on/mid-off/extra-cover, and this slower ball, which ends up as a low full-toss outside off stump, is also a hard one to put away. Hits low on the bat as Latham looks to go over mid-off, but he only succeeds in spooning it to the fielder. He goes for 47 - a scrappy innings, which could prove valuable for New Zealand if this pitch remains two-paced
TWM Latham c sub (JM Vince) b Woakes 47 (104m 56b 2x4 1x6) SR: 83.92

48.3
5w
Woakes to Latham, 5 wides, slower bouncer wide of leg stump, and it's run away for five wides. Latham had no option but to leave it, and the ball bounced a second time before reaching Buttler, who'd sidestepped to his right to get behind the ball, only for it to beat him with turn
48.2
1
Woakes to Santner, 1 run, slower length ball close to off stump, slanting away, swatted away to deep midwicket
48.1
1lb
Woakes to Latham, 1 leg bye, appeal for lbw as Latham looks to shuffle across and whip it leg side. Probably pitched outside leg, I reckon, but England have reviewed. The batsmen sneaked a risky leg bye, and Latham would have been out at the non-striker's end, by a number of feet, had Woakes hit direct, but he missed. Yup, it's pitched well outside leg stump.

Archer to Latham, 1 run, slower length ball on off stump, clipped away into the backward square leg region. They think of two, but the fielder is off the boundary in a flash to close down the ball
Ashutosh Sahoo: "This World Cup is turning out to be a battle of philosophies in a game format that's in a state of flux with the advent of T20 and facing existential challenges. There are two clear approaches - the classic approach and the hybrid ultra-modern approach.The classic approach, pioneered and practiced to perfection by India and followed by A/NZ, banks on solidity and conservation of resources. The threat of an under-par total is subverted by the odd impact players like Pandya/CDG/Maxwell. The hybrid approach is to stay on overdrive throughout the course of the innings but ameliorate the risks through multidimensional team selection giving inordinate depth to the batting order and by having one anchor player (like J Root or Shai Hope). Pioneered by England ever since their 2015 WC debacle, tried out by WIndies with sporadic success, this approach is an alluring future to the game of cricket but at the cost of the bowlers' graveyard."

Wood to Latham, 1 run, bouncer, gets over shoulder height and he hooks a little uppishly, but into the gap to the right of fine leg. de Grandhomme wants the second, he's sent back, and a more accurate throw to the keeper might have ended his innings. As it happened, Buttler had to run towards the silly point area to collect, and then he spun around and threw the stumps down, and the batsman was juuuust in
Given how hard the slower bouncer has been to score off, or even connect, I expect Lockie Ferguson and Neesham to bowl a lot of them today

44.4

Wood to Latham, no run, another blow to the body. Slower short ball, swivels through the pull too early and is hit on the stomach

44.2

Wood to Latham, no run, hits that hard length and slants it away from off stump. Can't drive, can't pull, so he ends up playing an in-between diagonal bat swat, and can't put bat to ball

0
Wood to Latham, no run, slower length ball, angling away from off stump. Looks to step across and swipe it away through midwicket, but the angle only allows him to play it to mid-on

Wood to de Grandhomme, 4 leg byes, ooh, that's a difficult bouncer to deal with. Wide of the crease, angling into the stumps, and in the end it only probably gets up to shoulder height, and de Grandhomme ducks a(wk)wardly. Hits his left shoulder and ricochets beyond the reach of the keeper trying to leap up to his left with one glove extended. Evasive action, so it counts as leg byes

Fullish on off stump, but it sits up a little off the pitch, and Neesham just doesn't time that attempted loft over mid-on. Comes off the bat with a weird clunk, and Root takes a straightforward catch at mid-on. Three wickets now for Plunkett. What a final he's having.

Two left-handers at the crease. Wood goes round the wicket to Jimmy Neesham.

Wood to Taylor, OUT, and he strikes first ball, and Taylor can't review because his old pal Martin Guptill used up New Zealand's only one. Length ball angling in from wide of the crease, and Taylor, shuffling across his crease, misses one as he plays around his front leg looking to work the ball square on the leg side. To me it seemed to bounce a fair amount, and it struck him above the knee-roll. Would that have hit the stumps? Marais Erasmus thought it would have... Ball tracking says it would have missed the top of leg stump.

Wood returns to the attack.

Suvadip : "I know you can't publish this but I must say, what a pale end to this exciting WC. This is not a thrilling contest by any means. Two teams having best points till semis should qualify for finals." -- This isn't dissimilar to how New Zealand's innings went against India, and we know how thrilling that game got towards its finish. And not sure why I can't publish it?

Thanks, Deiva. Latham's been hitting a lot of pretty shots straight to the fielders so far. An illustration of how the game is going on a wider scale. New Zealand have kept themselves there or thereabouts, but England haven't allowed them to get away at any point.

11.57am Thanks, KK. Hello, again, everyone. England's seamers kept pegging away around off - and outside off - with the new ball but Nicholls and Williamson rode out that phase. The semi-new ball is still nibbling around, how will Williamson and Nicholls go? A steady diet of singles and improved their scoring rate, though. Here is Plunkett from round the wicket


Asif Mujawar : "While I've always admired Kohli's ability to absorb the pressure and his game awareness which comes good 8/10 times, it's the big pressure games like ICC Knockouts he'll have to learn so much from Williamson in terms of reading the situation, staying calm in adverse and pressure situations and more importantly leading from the front. He's been failing in ICC knockouts for quite a long time now."

Deepankar DM: "Guptill's intent, 'few' runs, Nicholls excellent review, and the survival of the openers till 7 overs ensured this is a 50-50 start as opposed to a usual horror start. England seemed a little flat early, as did India few days ago. These little things can be so so useful in such situations. NZ winning these moments in the SF led to their eventual victory. Could be crucial in this match too! " -- England certainly haven't been flat from what I've seen of them. The ball's been nibbling around and they've been pretty accurate, though the TV commentators have pointed out that Archer could have been a little fuller - none of the balls he's bowled so far would have gone on to hit the stumps, by the estimation of ball-tracking.

Length ball, nips back in off the seam, and Guptill, looking to drive on the up through mid-off, is beaten on the inside edge. Hits the bent back leg, just above the flap of the pads. Impact is in line with middle and off, and the ball is hitting middle stump two-thirds of the way up. Why did he review that if there was no edge?

10.43am We've never really had a genuinely tense finish to a World Cup, and only a few truly competitive finals. 1979, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 were among the most one-sided ODIs of all time.
