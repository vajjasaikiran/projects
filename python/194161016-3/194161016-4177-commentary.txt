Offspinner pitched outside off and Babar was coming on the front foot to defend, but had his off-stump covered. No bat involves, but yes, it's well outside the line. Strange review, and they've lost it. Maybe they thought he wasn't playing a shot, so impact wouldn't matter?

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, strikes second ball!. Given lbw but the batsman goes up to review. That looked out on first sight. Pitched on a length and spun in, carrom ball, beat his defensive prod to strike him on the pad. Bat and pad are very close to together, and there is a spike. I think it's of ball hitting pad, there's a gap between ball and bat. The third umpire's thinking the same. And ball tracking shows three reds! So not only have Pakistan lost Fakhar, they've lost a review too.

2.37pm: Afghanistan in a huddle on the edge of the boundary. They'll need to bowl well and put Pakistan under pressure. The openers are walking out. Monga says, "This is Hamid Hassan's last match. He just got a guard of honour." He came back against all odds for this tournament - he was commentating when Afghanistan played Ireland in Dehradun!

There is history and background to the edge that a Pakistan-Afghanistan game carries. Sidharth Monga had presciently analysed the bad blood, before this match.

2.28pm: We should be re-starting the chase in about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the action on the field was rivetting enough, but off the field, it got ugly.

Shaheen Shah Afridi to Rashid Khan, OUT, the slower ball is unplayable today from Shaheen! This time Rashid is the one left looking like a schoolboy by Shaheen, producing an offcutter landing on a full length on off stump. Rashid can't keep his hands back long enough and aborts his drive resulting in a skier over mid-off. Simple catch take at chest height on the ring. Shaheen the dream!

Andy C: "What a shame if Ikram felt he had to go for the big shot, which is not his game. He was doing fine and especially with a wicket having just gone I would have been telling him to bat through the 50 overs and just look to nudge his strike rate up, leaving the big shots to the batters at the other end. That could have got them to 250 or so. Now you could easily see them capitulating to 190 all out in 43 overs" - there is definite value in what Ikram did to hold one end up, but I felt he batted too slowly despite that role.

Imad Wasim to Ikram Alikhil, OUT, the dot ball pressure on Ikram finally bursts! Floaty delivery at 84 kph/52 mph on about 7th/8th stump, just inside the wide guidelines, Ikram had to reach out a long way trying to slog this over long-on. Got more of the toe of the bat on it than middle and the ball loops in the air toward long-on. Simple catch taken at rib height 10 yards in from the rope.

It holds it's line instead of turning and he's beaten trying to club this back over Shadab's head as the ball clips off stump. A promising stand ends.

Rahmanullah Sha: "I do not know why everybody is criticizing Ali Khail inclusion in the team. He is a proper batsman like Rahmat and Shaidi. He did not do good at number eight because he is not a first ball hitman. He needs time to settle. He will do best in this position. I think if you are playing Ali Khail, you have to play him at this position, otherwise, you do not play him at all."

But for the other opinion, here's Andy C: "Interesting promotion of 18 year old Ikram to number 4 given a 12-match List A career average of 22 with strike rate of 59. He does have a FC century so his elevation must be an expression of belief in his ability. Hope he does well."

Some of you may have wondered why Afghanistan were slow in their batting approach early on, particularly when they were chasing small-ish targets. It's because there's a worrying pattern every time they score quickly. Varun has a hypothesis over at the Live Report.

Anand: "Hey Saurabh, looking at Alikhil's plight, do you think Afg shouldnt have send back Shahzad so abruptly especially with his injury not looking that "threatening" ?

Hat-trick ball on the way to be faced by... Ikram Alikhil?!?! Promoted up the order with not much to show for the bat so far this World Cup. Extra slip brought in.

Shaheen Shah Afridi to Hashmatullah Shahidi, OUT, he's on a hat-trick! What a whirlwind over! Not the best ball to be fair. Full and angling down leg, should have been ticked through fine leg for four but Hashmatullah is out in front of the ball and his attempt to play it through the leg side results in a leading edge that balloons over Shaheen towards mid-off. Imad jogs 10 yards left and takes it at waist height in stride.

Shaheen Shah Afridi to Gulbadin Naib, OUT, big nick! Or is it?! Given not out with Gulbadin driving well away from his body. Sarfaraz calls for the review! Seemed completely obvious live that he edged that ball but Nigel Llong didn't think so. Sarfaraz took an eternity to review overthinking things, i.e., was it so obvious that it wasn't an edge after all? Of course it was! Ultra-edge shows a clear spike when ball passes bat. Umpire Llong changes his signal.

Ahoy Saurabh! Good morning, great morning... no, it's a spectacular morning in Leeds as the Afghanistan opening pair walk out. Osman has this tidbit to pass along before play gets underway: "Wahab is playing of course but he injured his right hand pinky yesterday which will be bandaged. It could be something that has consequences beyond this match it sounds like but he's playing right now."

And please welcome Peter Della Penna, who will take you through the first bit.

10.24am: National anthems time.

10.20am: Meanwhile, Varun Shetty is manning our Live Report, and he has a poll for you: How much do Afghanistan need to make their bowlers comfortable? Vote here.

10.12am: We've got some time before the game starts. What's the best thing to do in that time? I can think of nothing better to do than to read two stunning pieces after Pakistan's last match, their win against New Zealand. Osman writes on The Age of Babar (and advises you not to read it, but ignore that). And Monga soaks in the atmosphere of "It" being on. It, is in fact lit.

Junaid shafi: "What a way to come back by Pakistan. Days before Top 4 teams are confirmed for semis, Now they fought for the sake for Semifinal. Only Pakistan can do that miracle. "

Tanzeel : "Afghanistan has a strong bowling attack and Pakistan always have difficulty in chasing so it would be interesting to see how Pakistan chase the total."

Hassaan: "Afghanistan played below expectation in this tournament, i think the change of captain at the 11th hour was not a good decision at all. Asghar Afghan was leading brilliantly and they fascinate the world with their quick progress under his captaincy."

Afghanistan won the toss and chose to bat.

Playing XIs:

Pakistan: 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Haris Sohail, 6 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt & (wk)), 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Mohammad Amir, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Shaheen Afridi

Afghanistan: 1 Gulbadin Naib (capt), 2 Rahmat Shah, 3 Hashmatullah Shahidi, 4 Asghar Afghan, 5 Samiullah Shinwari, 6 Mohammad Nabi, 7 Najibullah Zadran, 8 Ikram Alikhil ((wk)), 9 Rashid Khan, 10 Hamid Hassan, 11 Mujeeb Ur Rahman

Sarfaraz Ahmed: We wanted to bat first but unfortunately toss is not in our hands. Our bowling line-up is bowling well so hopefully they'll restrict them. Our momentum is very high, but we're focusing on this match, not focusing too far. Wahab had a bit of an issue but he's fine and playing today. We're going with the same team.

Gulbadin Naib: The wicket looks good, it's a sunny day. The wicket will help the spinners in the second innings. Pakistan is a good side, they've played plenty of good games. We beat them in the warm-up so we'll put our 100 percent in this game. Hamid is back in the side, in place of Dawlat. We'll try to put a good total on the board, so that it's better for the spinners.

9.58am: And don't forget our fantasy tips for this match, for those of you who're looking for an edge in fantasy cricket. Our experts picks have been spot on so far.


Hurmat: "Winning toss and bowling first will give an advantage here at Leeds. Fast bowlers and off spin gonna rock today. "

9.54am: Ian Bishop has a smile on his face because it's a beautifully sunny day. "The ground looks a picture," he says. Shorter square boundaries. The pitch has a few cracks, but nothing to worry about. It's expected to start slow and get better for batting as the day goes on, with the sun baking it.

Speaking of Osman, he's at Leeds and tells me it's likely Pakistan have the same XI. That's along expected lines, given how well they did in their last game against New Zealand.

And the 1992 dream is still alive for Pakistan. In fact, as Osman Samiuddin lays out, it's eerily alive.

9.45am: There's lots of talk about the rivalry between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's real, and it's been acquiring a bit of an edge. Sidharth Monga delves into the history of it, and hopes dignity wins over jingoism. Read it here.

Israr: "The way the sense of "rivalry" works in competitive sport, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will always find it difficult to beat Pakistan in the same way it is tough for Pakistan to beat India. When players look to become heroes by trying to give more than 100%, elementary mistakes are made because of the added self-imposed pressure."

Iftikhar Ahmed: "Hi Saurabh, good morning, watching cricket since 1979, this is my 10th world cup as spectator, so old now, but energy and cricket passion is same as a kid in 40 years back." - well done sir! Hats off to you.

Waqas Bajwa: "Big game today. Pakistan is known for winning against the tough teams and losing the easy ones. The only game WI has won is against Pakistan. Could the same be true for Afghanistan? "

Amanullah vreen: "Winning of this game will be like championship. Good luck ATTALAN"

9.39 am: Wondering what to keep an eye on in this game? Umar Farooq sets the scene in his preview.

Akshat: "For all those who think this will be a cake walk for Pakistan, remember that Afghanistan did beat them in the practice match by chasing 260 odd runs." - Indeed they did.

yousha Ahmed: "Want to see a Fight from Afghanistan"

Nadeem khan: "Need to win. Can not break the streak."

9.32 am: Hello and welcome to our live ball by ball commentary for the 36th match of the World Cup 2019. I'm Saurabh Somani and will be joined by Peter Della Penna. Can Pakistan keep their 1992 dream alive? Or will Afghanistan get a first win?
