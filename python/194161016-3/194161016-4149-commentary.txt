Cheers, Ankur. Well, Sri Lanka were 3/1 underdogs according to the UK high street oddsmakers at the start of this chase, but the tables turned almost in the exact opposite direction when Nabi fell to make it 57 for 5. At that stage, Afghanistan became 10/3 underdogs but have clawed back and now the oddsmakers have it straight down the middle. DLS calculation has Sri Lanka ahead though if the match were to end right now. Par after 20 overs is 105 with Afghanistan 5 down.

Pradeep to Hazratullah Zazai, OUT, OH MY GOODNESS! 10 OUT OF 10 FROM THE FRENCH JUDGE FOR THISARA PERERA! Pradeep bounced Zazai, who hooked flat and hard toward long leg. Thisara had about 1.5 seconds to cover 15 yards haring to his left. The ball never got more than 10-15 yards above the ground but he judged it immaculately before diving forward to clasp on two inches above the turf. Spectacular, a momentum-shifting effort!

Udana to Rahmat Shah, OUT, great bowling by Udana is rewarded! Udana kept on teasing Rahmat with that fourth/fifth stump line on a consistently good length. After nearly dragging on earlier in the over playing away from his body, Rahmat is sucked into another play well away from his body and this time it clips the outside edge. It carries to Mathews at thigh height, as he crouches slightly to cushion the take in the breadbasket. Sri Lanka starting to claw back!

Jenil: "This is one of those rare occasions where you see the beauty of DLS method as the score of first innings got reduced rather than incremented.

According to the revised conditions one bowler can bowl a maximum of nine and four can bowl up to eight overs.

Vishwas: "SL will be disappointed this to be a 41 over game. They would've preferred it to be a 35 over game. They not going to last 8 overs and then Afghanistan gets more over to bat. I still don't see this game finishing. They should've finished SLs innings and started with Afghanistan. One more spell of rain and the game is done. "

Jarrod Kimber from the press box: The adjusted target will be 14/15 less, according to ICC scorer

Adi: "Ankur - SL still might see and should see Nabi as a batsman. (He is in my fantasy league)" Astute observation

Qaaid Mowlana: "Honestly, SL don't deserve to win this match. This batting performance has been nothing short of disgraceful. For all the talk of the potential and ability of Kusal Mendis, he's lasted 3 deliveries across 2 games and has a grand total of 10 ODI ducks, which happens nearly once every 6 matches. Dhananjaya de Silva hasn't done too much better either. Talent is all well and good, but it's worthless if the results are this bad"

3.30pm So, we have a 4pm start - half an hour from now - and not a significantly curtailed game. It's 41-overs per side and a ten minute innings turnover. Good news for Sri Lanka, they'll see no more of Mohammad Nabi

Thanks, Peter. And I bring with me encouraging news. All the covers are off and the umpires have also walked out to the middle for the promised inspection

3.15 pm - Inspection in 10 minutes! That's my cue to exit stage left for now. Hope you were mildly entertained over the course of the past two hours, chicken korma and all. Ankur is here!

Tillakaratne Dilshan meanwhile has been stewing during the rain break over the Sri Lanka collapse. According to Dilshan, his countrymen have been batting like 'small kids'.

As the ground staff gets moving in Cardiff, here's some non-cricket reading material to pique your interest: The Jamaican Reggae Girlz are the first Caribbean team in history to qualify for the FIFA Women's World Cup, which starts later this week. And the biggest catalyst for that team's rise has been Bob Marley's daughter.

3.00 pm - THE RAIN HAS STOPPED! Now it's a matter of how much water the ground is able to soak up. It's been coming down for just about two hours. May take a bit more time before a possible resumption, and that's if the rain doesn't come back.

Still raining in Cardiff, but Sharda Ugra has some intelligence info to share for traveling media heading to Cardiff for the next match at the venue on June 8 between England and Bangladesh: "Coffee is a 6/10, tea is 10/10 for range [of options]." Separately, a papare band from Melbourne has gotten back to playing their music in the stands after taking a break for lunch.

Osama: "Finland became the Ice Hockey champions for the third time. It's ridiculous to even consider them an underdog. Afghanistan, definitely come as an underdog." Jari Kurri, Teemu Selanne and Esa Tikkanen, who are doubtless hardcore ESPNcricinfo ball-by-ball commentary fans, have just given a raised eyebrow at the earlier underdog claim put on Finland...

2.37 pm We're now at 90 minutes of play lost since the umpires took both teams off the field, so now into deducting overs territory. :-( Reminder that there's no reserve days in the round-robin pool stage so if they can't get at least 20 overs in the second innings, the teams split points. Not sure which team will be more disappointed. In spite of Sri Lanka's collapse today, Afghanistan's batsmen didn't cover themselves in glory during their tournament opener.

MahaSach: "From the Hospital in Paris, I am a Data Scientist here. I have always loved the statistics and the graphical representation of Cricinfo. Good job guys :)"

Tausif: "Preparing for my last and final MBA exam in Dubai. But can't resist checking the updates on SL v/s AFG. Can we share some of this intense sunshine from Dubai to the UK? Eid Mubarak fellas!" Tausif couldn't hear you Davo. Could you repeat that?

Davo: "One thing i've learnt over the years following cricinfo commentary, especially during rain breaks....there's always a guy that's here commenting about an upcoming exam."

Hashaam Akhtar: "Eid Mubarak to all of you from Magdeburg Germany... It's hot here but luckily we have a cool n calm lake beside our apartment... I hope Afghanistan also celebrates the Eid with a cool Win"

Vipul Sharma: "Cursing the cold weather here in Tampere, Finland. The country just became ice hockey world champions as underdogs and I am now explaining my Finnish friends that Afghanistan is trying to do the same!"

Affnafee Rahman: "I have my Oxford exams from Monday and boy are those intense. But, this match is soooo interesting- Afg is setting themselves up for a victory. Not willing to miss the action, but I guess the rain wants me to study. Eid mubarak from the UK!"

Omer: "Hope to see more action, it eid day here in USA, I wish I was in Kabul watching and cheering for Afghanistan, I am working and I am in middle of desert in Arizona cheering for Afghanistan "

shameer: "You go to Hawaii to eat Indian food? :P" You can play cricket there too, right underneath Diamond Head at Kapiolani Park just a few blocks from the shores of Waikiki Beach. Aloha and mahalo to Honolulu Cricket Club!

2.15 We're past the hour mark in the rain delay. Grim update from Sharda Ugra inside the Cardiff press box: "Still coming down. Forecast is rain for rest of day. One more burst coming in about an hour."

DANISH Khan : "Did you use DARLING, so your wife cook for you again? Or u use it as she is also reading. BTW, I m just taking sun bath under UAE FURIOUS SUN" - Option C Danish: Making up for the time I told her that the best chicken korma I ever had was at an Indian restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii. What can I say? The coconuts were super fresh on the island!

Vinod Tanwani: "Toronto - Canada is freezing , wanted to see good competition while having cup of tea but rain god is not so kind today. "

Muntasir: "Just came back from Eid Jamat in New York. Eid Mubarak everyone."

Zammam: "Working on my school report while drinking a hot cup of tea to warm me up during the cold weather in Melbourne."

Time for me to have some leftover yummy chicken korma that my darling wife cooked for me a few nights ago to fill the time during the rain delay. How are you passing the time out there?

Nikhil N: "What is the highest number of extras in a World Cup match" and "was there any match with extras more than the score of the batsmen"" The record for extras in an ODI was done twice by Pakistan with 59 conceded v Australia at Brisbane in 1989 and again in the 1999 World Cup v Scotland. As for extras as high score in an ODI innings, it has happened on 39 occasions. The highest extras and team total were both done by New Zealand v Pakistan at Old Trafford in 1999 World Cup - 47 in a total of 241 for 7 - while the most recent instance happened in 2013 when West Indies batsmen could not top 17 extras in a score of 70 against Australia at Perth.

While you're waiting out the rain, hear what Daren Ganga and Ajit Agarkar have to say on ESPNcricinfo's Match Day during the delay. Our pair of studio experts say Sri Lanka could be in an even bigger hole if Rashid had been brought on earlier. I mean, Nabi was communicating much the same with us telepathically on the ball-by-ball reader feedback while he was in the middle of his first spell around the 15th over.

World Cup playing regulations state that there's 75 minutes of wiggle room before overs get deducted. So we've got about an hour more to go before we hit that mark.

Radar is showing a cell of rain hovering around the ground for the next hour or so. Sharda Ugra from the ground is reporting that the rain has gotten heavier.

Ishan: "What is with all the extras?? It's like SL have 12 batsmen!" Afghanistan have really let them off the hook with the no balls and wides. Not just that, Sri Lanka scored a boundary off of each of the three free hits following Gulbadin's three no balls.

1.06 pm. And the groundstaff charge onto the pitch! Unbelievable drama ramps up a notch as the match is stopped with the rain getting too thick! An hour ago, Afghanistan wouldn't have minded a rain break but now Sri Lanka are the ones probably over the moon to have a chance to get up off the mat for a standing eight-count.

Malinga was five yards short but Shahzad was pulled away from the stumps by Dawlat's hurried throw and his flick back to the stumps wasn't going to be in time as a result.

Rashid Khan to MDKJ Perera, OUT, MY GOODNESS! Goes for the reverse sweep and now goes to the pavilion! He tried to pick the line on about fourth stump with Rashid regularly bowling googlies, it's not the worst option as he'd be hitting with the spin. But the length is a touch too full for the shot. The result is he gloves it instead of getting any bat on it. Shahzad holds onto the deflection. Sri Lanka's set man is gone!

SL team management might be doing more than that once Udana walks through the changing room door.

Sri Lanka have an abysmal record chasing since January 2018, having won only two of 13 completed matches batting second, so being asked to bat isn't the worst thing. But can their batsmen cope with conditions where the ball is likely to do wicked things? In their favour is the fact that its unlikely to have a change of heart mid-way through the innings, so there's no reason for their bowlers to feel any sense of FOMO

Thanks, Peter Della Penna for the wise words and a riveting build-up.

10.27. Afghanistan are huddling on the outfield now. Looks like more stewards than spectators in the section leading out from the change rooms. Hopefully more fans fill in the seats as the day goes on. That's all from me for the time being. Here to take over for the start of play is Ankur Dhawan. Take it away Ankur!

Anthems being sung, Sri Lanka first. Sparse crowd through the gates at the moment. Afghanistan follow. Happy Eid/Eid Mubarak to all those following from Kabul and beyond!

As the teams prepare to take the field for the national anthems, here's one more piece for you to munch on over breakfast. Sid Monga sat down with Gulbadin Naib, who was named Afghanistan's ODI captain on the eve of the World Cup and is still pinching himself.

Hashir: "Being a Sri Lankan fan with memories of the last few World Cups, after every match of recent times, there is despair. But, as always, we have hope beyond hope that one day, we will achieve the potential that this team promises. The current crop is good, but its coming of age right now. All they need is a click, and let's hope they get it today."

Cardiff has been a house of horrors for Sri Lanka well before the thrashing meted out by Kane Williamson's men on Saturday. As Sharda Ugra notes, Sri Lanka have never won a match at the venue.

10.18 am For all the Jarrod Kimber-philes out there, he's got you covered with a tale of two aging quicks: Hamid Hassan and Lasith Malinga, who are trying to conjure up a bit of nostalgia for their respective countries as they take the field for their last World Cup.

If being taken through ball-by-ball by an American is just not cricket for you, Shamya Dasgupta is keeping the masses entertained on the live report for today's match. Beware, you may not escape me judging by a poll put up last game by my main man Deiva Muthu. ESPNcricinfo studio analyst Daren Ganga is currently expressing surprise on our live studio show with Afghanistan's decision to keep Mujeeb in the XI considering he bowled less than half his quota against Australia.

More from Sharda Ugra in Cardiff: "Okay I've just come in from outside the ground and there is a STREAM of people coming. From outside like non stop it'll take them time to get in. A crowd of 13,000 are expected."

Jess: "I'm surprised that Afghanistan didn't play a 3rd seamer (Aftab) today. On a surface like this Mujeeb is unlikely to be effective and they won't be able to take full advantage of helpful swing-bowling conditions."

Afghanistan XI: 1 Mohammad Shahzad ((wk)), 2 Hazratullah Zazai, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi, 5 Najibullah Zadran, 6 Mohammad Nabi, 7 Gulbadin Naib (capt), 8 Rashid Khan, 9 Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, 10 Hamid Hassan, 11 Dawlat Zadran. So Afghanistan keep faith in Mujeeb, who has looked very out of sorts in recent times. Looked like there was a good chance Aftab Alam might come in as an extra medium pace option in local conditions but not today.

Sri Lanka XI: 1 Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), 2 Lahiru Thirimanne, 3 Kusal Perera ((wk)), 4 Kusal Mendis, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Dhananjaya de Silva, 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Isuru Udana, 9 Suranga Lakmal, 10 Nuwan Pradeep, 11 Lasith Malinga. Pradeep was sensational in against Scotland in Sri Lanka's last ODI before the start of the tournament, taking four wickets in a Man of the Match effort.

One change for Sri Lanka: Jeevan Mendis out Nuwan Pradeep is in from their loss v New Zealand.

Dimuth: Last game we batted first and now we know how the conditions will play. It's certainly not a 300 wicket but we know the best score on this wicket. It's not easy [being handed captaincy so soon before tournament] but I've got a couple of captains in the past who give me support.

Afghanistan are playing an unchanged XI.

Gulbadin: If you look at the conditions, it's good for the bowlers and with cloudy weather. It's a good toss to win. We got a lot of things from the last game, especially with the batters how we struggled in the middle. I'm not looking in the past how we played against Sri Lanka. They are a good, champion side.

10.03 am Toss time! Ian Bishop is on screen with Gulbadin Naib and Dimuth Karunaratne. Gulbadin spins it, Dimuth calls wrong and Gulbadin chooses to bowl first.

Surath: "It looks like there's a lot going on inside the dressing room judging by what Malinga had to say yesterday."

Abilash: "Happy to see Srilanka get a tough one from the Afghans. Afghans deserve the respect and their players are more than capable. Afghanistan deserves much more as a country. RESPECT" Well, Afghanistan did beat Sri Lanka after all in the Asia Cup last year to KO them from the event.

Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga sent down a fiery yorker or two on the eve of the match, trying to light a fire under some of his team-mates by saying they need to feel 'the shame of losing' and that they've been moving from defeat to defeat without learning any lessons in recent times according to this news filing from Jarrod Kimber.

Sharda Ugra is in Cardiff and she passes along this news from the ground: "The forecast for Cardiff looks good despite overnight rain. We can only a see handful of cricket fans walking through - three Sri Lankan jerseys at the far end of the ground. There are more people on the field than in the stands, promise."
