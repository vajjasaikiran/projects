5.30pm Hello, again. A hundred from current captain Faf du Plessis and a near-hundred from future captain Rassie van der Dussen have set Australia a daunting 326. Their openers are in stellar form, though. If they give Australia another strong start, they can bring the target within Australia's reach. At the innings break, du Plessis said that change of pace was the key on this track. South Africa have two wristspinners and Andile to mix it up in the middle overs. Warner and Finch make their way out to the middle. The departing Tahir will open the attack for SA.

Aravind: "Van der Dussen well ahead of the nearest competitors in terms of highest batting average with no hundreds in a career spanning 10 or more innings. At 73.77, his is the only average over 50, with the next closest Ian Chappell averaging 48." --- Believe it or not, by this time last year he was playing in the Global T20 Canada. Now he has fit into SA's middle order and has become an impressive T20 player. More recently, he was a vital part of Lions' title win in the CSA T20 Challenge

FredH: "This would not be the highest chase in World Cups; Ireland successfully chased England's 327 in 2011." --- Yes, indeed

The 1992 vs 2019 comparisons are over for Pakistan, but one connection to the '92 World Cup still remains, as England have made the semis for the first time in 27 years. Do you remember what the sporting world was like back then? Here's a quiz to test your knowledge.

5.06pm South Africa have left Australia needing to pull off the highest chase in a World Cup. It was set up by Quinton de Kock's pulsating start, sustained by Faf du Plessis's industry and then when it mattered towards the end, Rassie van der Dussen delivered. He's quickly risen to be counted as one of the key members of this batting line-up going forward. With a number of big-ticket retirements expected, that can't really be a bad thing.

For Australia, Starc had an off-day, his first spell being as wayward as you may have seen him for a long, long time. Lyon easily the pick of the bowlers. In general, the faster men struggled, largely because they couldn't quite hit the right lengths on a surface that is getting slower. Join us in 30 minutes as Deiva will be back to kick off the chase.

Faf Du Plessis says: Glad to get a decent total. We needed partnerships, talked about guys putting their hands up to get bigger scores. No one had really done it, the kind of scores that wins you games, [good to see] Rassie do well. Pace off the ball will be key in the second innings. Would've taken this total, extremely happy.

Starc to Duminy, 1 run, right into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on

Rakesh Sampat: "331 looks to be just about par score here. The South Africans having nothing to lose should have put the foot on the gas pedal a bit earlier and aimed for 350+. Currently, they don't even look good for 320 and might end up around 300-310, throwing away a great start. The likes of Morris must play astounding cameos under such circumstances."

Behrendorff to du Plessis, OUT, slices a slog to short third man. End of a fab, fab knock. It's amazing how batsmen play clean shots and get the big hits even if they don't wish to. The moment they start slogging, they end up miscuing and edging. Looked to pull, played too early, didn't pick the slower ball and was through with the shot nearly as it lobbed off the toe end. Fine knock and rightly applauded off the field.

kevin: "how come bavuma isn't in consideration for an ODI spot, at least in the bigger squad? seems like a solid batsman, though possibly not explosive, and excellent in the field.

Here's what our SA correspondent Liam Brickhill's take is: And with an average of 80! (albeit from just two ODIs). Seriously though, Bavuma hasn't been part of SA's one-day plans after being pigeonholed a little as a long format batsman, but that's set to change. And soon: in fact, he will captain the South Africa A one-day side on their tour to India in August and September. So he is very much entering the one-day frame now, albeit a little late.

Lyon to Markram, SIX runs, steps out and launches him over long-on without a trace of worry. Pressure? What pressure? It's all off us at the moment, he seems to be saying. This is what playing with a clutter-free mind can do to you. Real pressure on the Aussie bowlers

Dumiso: "Plot twist! Sri Lanka and South Africa beat the top two just to add a little flavour to the tournament. Alas too little too late."

Cummins to de Kock, 1 run, mid-off dives to get some hand on it. Warner with the full stretch, once again timed so well and was destined to the boundary. Warner saved three.

Prajwal: "A high score isn't the worst thing for Australia. They haven't chased down a target so far so it might actually help them."

Cummins to de Kock, FOUR runs, he's already had me ooooohing and aaaaahing enough. Just keeps getting better! Nothing wrong with the delivery - a length ball angled across, but de Kock shows excellent footwork and hand-eye coordination as he laces this through extra cover. Raced away

Behrendorff to Markram, FOUR runs, as good as it gets! Shot of the morning. Behrendorff delivers a juicy half-volley and Markram plays a copy book cover drive right out of the top drawer. Can go any distance to watch strokes like that

Behrendorff to Markram, FOUR runs, width and he's crashed this wide of point. No chance again for third man, who was a touch too fine. Didn't think he hit it all that well initially

Rabi chimes in: "Don't agree with the Miller part , he has never truly lived up to his potential. Always picked in the hope he will deliver but hasn't."

Jason says: "So, when it's too late, South Africa finally make a good decision and bat Markram where he should be. Amla should not have been picked on his legacy. The guy hasn't been in form for a long time! The balance would have been so much better if we started with a team that looked like this. I still don't quite like it but with the limited pool of talent it's better. I just with Miller had found some rhythm - but, if this was the initial batting line it would have potentially helped him play more freely" -- Agree, peeps?

Rumplestiltskin: "I must admit I've found Markram's struggles in ODI cricket quite strange, given his performances in Test cricket. Usually it's the other way round. He is a class player, though, dynamite through the off side, and surely it won't be too log before he cracks the code."

1.28pm Markram to open with de Kock today. We're ready for action. You can chip into our #LiveReport where Liam Brickhill asks you for your opinion.

We're into the final game of the league phase, which was in danger of becoming a snoozefest halfway in, before Sri Lanka woke the World Cup up by beating England. It's turned out alright eventually! Sid Monga and Fidel Fernando were in a remote corner of a Newcastle cemetery on our latest Talking World Cup podcast, taking up the tale of how Sri Lanka (and Pakistan fans) brought World Cup 2019 to life (you can also listen on Apple Podcasts here)

It's time for the anthems. Hello, everyone. G'day. News if you're just joining us: Maxwell fit to play.

1.20pm Notable news for fans in the UK - the World Cup final could be shown on free-to-air if England make it through their semi (potentially against India). In the meantime, a different World Cup has been capturing the public imagination this summer. Here's Sharda Ugra on how men's cricket lost to women's football in the UK.

On that note, I'll hand over the controls to Shashank Kishore. See you soon

George Dobell from Old Trafford: Boos when Steven Smith's name announced.

Ramble: "The last time I remember Shamsi facing the Aussies was in Port Elizabeth in 2016. Bowled really well, taking three wickets including Smith. Good option for the match. I was wondering if SA would be brave enough to play him and Tahir together more often, but it didn't turn out that way."

1.15pm We have a double treat for you, our Indian viewers. Unable to catch Australia v South Africa because you're watching India v Sri Lanka? How could we let you suffer. You can watch the game LIVE on HOTSTAR. Those in the USA can't be left too far behind either. WATCH HERE

1pm Toss: South Africa choose to bat

Faf du Plessis: We haven't played our best cricket, so disappointed. But playing Australia are the best games to be part of.

South Africa make a forced change, with left-arm wristspinner Tabraiz Shamsi replacing Hashim Amla, who is nursing a knee injury

Right, Shamsi-Tahir together one last time for South Africa. Shami looks up to Tahir and had told me last year about Tahir's influence on his career. I'm looking forward to the double shoe-telephone.

Aaron Finch: Few boys got their feet up and good to get away. We are unchanged and it seems to be working for us.
