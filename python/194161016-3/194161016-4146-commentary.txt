Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Maxwell, FOUR runs, well my forecasting skills are not exact but Maxwell does finish it off with a boundary. Full ball outside off and slaughtered over extra cover, two bounces into the fence to clinch victory for Australia.

So it won't be a fairytale comeback of Smith and Warner sharing an unbeaten partnership to drive Australia to victory. Maybe Glenn Maxwell will hit a six to finish to compensate?

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Smith, OUT, anti-climax wide outside off and it was there to be square driven, but bounced a bit more than he expected and he gets an upper edge that loops to short third man. Smith falls with just three runs to get for victory

Who must each get 10 friends too. And so on...

Dawlat stood mid-pitch never bothering to get back over the stumps while Zazai was slow moving to cover the stumps from mid-off as well. Double-lapse not covering the relay or else the bails could've been knocked off easily. Dawlat gestures at Zazai upset at him for not covering but he is as much to blame.

Khawaja looked like he wanted to go with another reverse to a good length ball pitching on middle, then changed his mind while the ball was in the air and a(wk)wardly waved across the line. Plonked on the knee roll, big appeal upheld. Khawaja has a brief chat with Warner before deciding to walk off without using the review. Looked pretty straight. Replays confirm it would have been three reds on balltracking.

He wasn't ordained as a future Australia captain or one-in-a-generation talent, but Aaron Finch has begun Australia's World Cup defence with a muscular fifty.

Rashid being one of the top bowler conspicuously never bowls in power plays managing his RR and strike rate." - you've got your wish. Here's Rashid.

Ghairat: "That over from Hamid Hassan was a treat to watch. Afghanistan was standing tall among its peer associates because of fast bowlers. It is great to see him in furious mode again. "

Dawlat Zadran to Warner, 1 no ball, inexplicable overstep. Cummins did the same thing with his first ball of the match in the second over and now Dawlat matches him with a strange mental lapse. How do you not have your run-up correct at the start of your spell? Fullish length ball that Warner shoulders arms to but it doesn't count as part of the over.

Mujeeb gets yanked after two very tame overs. Dawlat Zadran enters the attack with more fast-medium pace. One slip in bowling over the stumps to the lefty Warner.

Afghanistan take the field now ready to defend 207. Peter Della Penna in the commentary position for you at home or on the go. Of the Asian sides to play so far, they've put up the best fight with the bat over the first three days. Still monumental underdogs to defend this total. But despite Afghanistan's spinners populating the Big Bash, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb ur Rahman have never faced Australia in an ODI.

Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, no run, that's some interesting play. Mujeeb was walking across very much, but Cummins followed him with a short ball that he ends up having to fend in ungainly fashion from in front of his face

Supradeep: "Afghanistan has been impressing me with their big heart for a long time. But this batting performance I think is one of their best ever. This score card is anything but an aberration. They have stood up to the fastest bowlers around on what is seeming like a very good fast bowlers track. Elsewhere established teams are still not able to get it together on similar conditions. Thoroughly inspiring."

Zampa to Rashid Khan, SIX runs, smoked straight over. If Rashid can't read leggies, who can? Down the track, got to the pitch and lifted this straight up and over with arms extended and a free swing of the bat. Up, up and over

Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 1 run, oooh, that might be painful. Struck on his fingers, back of a length ball cutting in. Cummins was following the batsman who was backing away and Mujeeb had to fend it off from near his chest towards midwicket
36.4
6
Cummins to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, SIX runs, ho ho ho, Afghanistan's spinners are having fun - with the bat! That's a top edged six. The downside to bowling quick is that when a Mujeeb backs away to pull, and gets a top edge, it flies over fine leg!

Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, OUT, can't do it twice in a row against Cummins! This time the short ball is directed over leg stump, so Dawlat's short-arm-jab-I-won't-look-at-it pull isn't quite as effective and he feathers an edge through to the keeper

Cummins to Dawlat Zadran, FOUR runs, that's a strange shot but he'll get a boundary.

Luckily for him, connection was good and he gets a boundary to square leg

Stoinis to Najibullah Zadran, OUT, two in two to the short ball. Looked like an off-cutter, and Najibullah is also gone.

Stoinis to Gulbadin Naib, OUT, oh he's thrown it away. Short ball outside off and he wanted to fetch the pull from there to midwicket. Doesn't come off and the ball just zooms up in the air and towards where short leg would have been. Carey runs forward and settles under it. Crucial wicket, at a crucial time. Clever bowling by Stoinis, he bowled it slower which meant Naib couldn't get the timing right.

Starc to Najibullah Zadran, no run, on target immediately, and has Najibullah hobbling with an inducker that's nipped in off a length and struck him on the knee. That caught the area just outside the pad. Painful

We're having a delay for a number of reasons. Sightscreen issues, and one of the Afghanistan batsmen had to make a quick visit because nature was calling, as per Michael Atherton on air.

Saif: "I don't understand why Australia didn't go for the kill like WI or NZ. They should have gone for all out attack and perhaps should have given longer spells to Starc and Cummins. Should bring Maxwell now to take wicket of Najibullah. " - well, looks like they're going for Starc. Afghanistan's sixth-wicket pair have counter-attacked so well that Finch has been forced to turn to his strike bowler once again. Let's see how this contest goes.

Romal: "Najibullah always playing crucial knocks against tough oppositions, remember his 56 of 56 against New Zealand in WC2015. Want to see some more big hits from him."

Thanks PDP. Back in the hot seat with this Sid Monga nugget from Bristol: "David Warner is signing autographs at the long-on boundary almost after every ball."

Same line and length as the previous ball from Stoinis full on fourth stump, but this time Nabi opens the face on his drive to try to squeeze it through the covers. Smith takes a step left before diving full extension to knock it down with his left hand. Nabi set off without hesitation believing he placed it wide enough for a safe run. But Smith, the puma in the ring! Gulbadin never left more than a few yards from the non-striker's end seeing Smith's effort but Nabi is so far down that Smith has time to get up off his knees and deliver a firm throw to Carey at head height on his way to the stumps and knocks the bails off with Nabi three yards short scampering back in vain.

Cummins to Rahmat Shah, no run, good length ball, some bite off the pitch as a touch of extra bounce climbs on Rahmat defending on the front foot. The ball takes the shoulder of the bat but he's able to keep it down with soft hands. Eventful start by Australia's new-ball pair!

Cummins to Hazratullah Zazai, OUT, ooooooohhhh big blow to nab the big bashing lefty! Another victim down to no footwork. Cummins angled this across on a good to full length, not nearly full enough to drive especially with his front foot going nowhere towards the ball, Zazai gets a healthy edge easily snapped up by Carey.

Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, OUT, bowled him. Or has he! They're checking the front foot with the third umpire. It was very full on the stumps. Starc could see off the previous ball that Shahzad's footwork wasn't engaged this early and he got this one to swing in but this time on the middle stump line. Shahzad was late trying to stab it out playing slightly across the line. The front foot is deemed to be just okay in the end. Super start for Starc.

Mitchell Starc is taking the new ball for Australia, over the stumps. Mohammad Shahzad on strike to open for Afghanistan in the World Cup. He was stunningly left out on fitness concerns when they made their World Cup debut in 2015.

Thanks Saurabh! Spine-tingling scenes with Afghanistan standing for the national anthem in Bristol. Who would have thought when they made their first visit to the British Isles 11 years ago to the Channel Islands, Jersey specifically, for 2008 World Cricket League Division Five, that they'd be returning to the UK for a World Cup before many in that side, including Mohammad Nabi and Hamid Hassan, had concluded their careers.

Handing it over to Peter Della Penna for the first bit.

1.25pm: Time for the national anthems.

Jacob: "I think ESPN deserve some credit for all the outstanding articles they've written on this World Cup, it's been outstanding!" - why thank you Jacob!

Dhaval : "Afghanistan should look to bat full 50 overs without thinking how many runs they score. We have seen their skills. It's time to show their temperament to the World. "

1.20pm: While waiting for the match to start, why don't you sink your teeth into this fantastic profile on Aaron Finch, the Australia captain. "He sets no drinking records, his sledges don't make compendiums of the "art form", and he doesn't sport a comedy moustache," writes Jarrod Kimber. But there's something about Finchy.

Athal Afghan : "Not a surprise, Asghar is out of Fm hope to see him in good touch very soon, but this the best selection for playing 11"

Mohammad Raza: "Good decision that Asghar is not playing today"

1.15pm: It might have flown under the radar somewhat because they played in the IPL and then in several warm-up matches - but this will be the first international outing for Steven Smith and David Warner since their ball-tampering bans. How will they go? And how will England's crowds respond to them? Justin Langer, for one, is firmly in the 'don't boo them' camp. Read his plea to England fans here.

Ihsan Shagiwal : "Read the Superb Piece written on Hamid Hassan! Wow! Hasan is amazing player and a real hero! I'm praying for his health! He is the only piece missing in the Afghan team's perfection! Btw, early morning Saturday morning here in San Francisco, California and I woke up to watch the game :) "

1.10 pm: Surprise, surprise - no Asghar Afghan for Afghanistan!
