Phehlukwayo to Williamson, FOUR runs, Williamson - you beauty! It had to end this way, right? That dab down to third man. Back of a length and outside off, glides it away behind point and seals it for NZ like boss. He is the boss. Meanwhile, South Africa's World Cup hopes are effectively ended

Phehlukwayo to Williamson, SIX runs, Grant Elliott: 2015. Kane Williamson: 2019. New Zealand are having the times of their lives once again. What an incredible century from Kane Williamson. This was full and outside off, slower variation, Williamson picks it, drops down to one knee and smokes it away into the stands beyond midwicket. Williamson eases the helmet off his head and soaks everything in

Phehlukwayo to Santner, 1 run, hip-high short ball on middle, Santner pulls and finds deep midwicket

New Zealand need 8 off the last over. Can they have the times of their lives once again? Andile will bowl the final over. Faf has a lengthy discussion with him. Okay, guess what the ZING BAILS have stopped play. Scenes at Edgbaston. Sid Monga from the venue: "They are taking the bail from the non-strikers' end to the striker's end. I am not sure the zing is working on the bails now"

Long-on, long-off, two men in the deep on the leg side, sweeper cover in the deep. No short third man or deep third man

Ngidi to Williamson, FOUR runs, That artistic dab from Williamson fetches him a crucial four. Slower ball, Ngidi rolls his fingers across the ball and pushes it outside off, Williamson waits for the ball to arrive, then glides it - like only he can - fine of short third man for four. First boundary for Williamson after 38 balls, I'm told. Significant one

WATCH - Williamson survives again as South Africa blow a run-out chance (Australia, UK and SEA only)

Rabada to Williamson, 1 leg bye, Oh my, a comedy of errors at Edgbaston. Awful mix-up between the wickets. Miller fluffs a run-out chance and reprieves Williamson. This was another well-directed short ball at the body, comes off pretty slow off the surface. Williamson is early into the pull and wears it on his body. De Grandhomme wants a single, Williamson doesn't. Rabada, the bowler himself, swoops down on the ball. The throw is to Miller at the non-striker's end. He is in a rush. He is under pressure. He dislodges the bails without collecting the ball. What a big miss for SA. Is that the game?

Right then, it's down to NZ needing 58 off 54 balls with five wickets in the shed. Fasten your seat belts for this could be another blockbuster between these two sides

Morris returns.

Jon Snow: "Pakistanis eagerly waiting for Williamson's wicket here.. come on Tahir, do your homeland a favour ;)"

Rabada to Neesham, no run, bit of an appeal for caught behind. A short one at around chest height, hops up and across to try and glance it fine, and I don't know what it hit, but there was a faint suggestion of something - thigh pad? - on it.

Brilliant over from Ferguson, only two off it plus the wicket of Phehlukwayo. Can Henry follow up with another good'un?

Boult to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, and he absolutely smashes this. Poor ball from Boult, half-volley on off stump, and he clears his front leg, leans back, and wallops this between the umpire and the non-striker

Van der Dussen is ready to face again.

Yoga: "I always felt that Miller is like Raina for India, comes to bat often after 30th over sometimes after 40, has to keep the run rate right from the 1st ball, when trying to accelerate gets out mostly in 30s and some 50s and rarely gets a big one. And not the least a left handed and similar batting position." -- Pretty good comparison. Both have their technical limitations, but it's a difficult job and they've often done a very good job of it.

Boult to van der Dussen, no run, extra bounce from a short length. Ends up cramped for room trying to pull a shoulder-high ball, ends up gloving it into his helmet grille. Ouch. Out comes the physio to check on van der Dussen's right thumb. A liberal application of magic spray

Boult to Phehlukwayo, no run, length ball, fifth-stump line, Phehlukwayo flashes a drive without moving his feet and can't make contact. Was looking to hit that through cover point

Boult continues, over the wicket to Phehlukwayo.

Ferguson to van der Dussen, 2 runs, slower ball, back of a length on off stump, helped away through backward square leg, looking for the gap rather than for power - he was looking for two from the moment he played it

Phehlukwayo is the new batsman.

Arun: "VdD's batting reminds me of Daryll Cullinan..(bit of 90s nostalgia).. calm composed and busy" -- Cullinan was way more stylish, to my eyes at least!

Ferguson to Miller, OUT, makes himself plenty of room and Ferguson bangs in a short ball, slanting away from Miller. The ball is rising steeply, and he's moving away from it's line, so he can't quite control the uppercut, ends up offering a catch to third man moving to his left. Good innings, though. He's given South Africa a bit of momentum

Boult to Miller, SIX runs, shot. That's very well played.

Boult to Miller, no run, misses out. On the shorter side of a length, but plenty of width, and he slaps it straight to extra-cover. There's an appeal for a run-out at the non-striker's end...

Santner to Amla, OUT, bowled him, that's slightly loose from Amla. Good ball from Santner, though, hits an excellent length and spins from middle stump to hit top of off. Amla, though, was trying to stay leg-side of the ball and play that with an open face, looking to dab into the point region, which is a risky shot if all you're looking for is a single

Boult to Amla, no run, beauty. He's been getting consistent swing back into the right-hander, and this one just keeps going with the angle. Back of a length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away, and it beats the outside edge as Amla aims a back-foot punch at it

Avinash Singh: "I just came across the Sign language commentary in the Guernsey v Norway ICC Men's T20 World Cup Global Qualifier. It is just amazing in every aspect of the game."

Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs, shot! A touch overpitched this time, but again a big stride forward to ensure he's close to the pitch, and he drives between mid-off and short extra-cover

Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs, full outside off, and that's a good shot even though it isn't off the middle of the bat. It isn't a half-volley, and it's swinging back in, but du Plessis got a big stride forward, ensuring he reduced the width of the swing at the point of impact, and the ball rolled away to the right of mid-off off the inside half of the bat

Henry to Amla, no run, back of a length on middle stump, clipped to the left of square leg, where the fielder makes a good diving stop

Was Amla having some trouble shuffling too far across his stumps? He's taking guard outside leg stump today, so that his shuffle doesn't take him as far across.

Henry to Amla, no run, good length again, closer to off stump. Judges it well and leaves it again

Sam : "Lots of talk and articles written about bat dominating ball, but there have been some brilliant fast bowling in this World Cup. " -- Indeed. Boult and Henry have been pretty good too, so far, and bowled a fuller length than most teams at the tournament. Lots of leaves - tells you how much it's swinging, and that these two have batted pretty well too.

Boult to Amla, 1 run, ooh, good ball. Good length, slanting across into the corridor, and gets some extra bounce. Takes the shoulder of the bat as Amla props half-forward to defend, but he plays with soft hands and it doesn't carry to the fielder at slip

Round the wicket now.

Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, shot! Given that Amla doesn't really get on the front foot to most deliveries, bowlers can occasionally try and go fuller to try and draw him forward. This one's got a bit of width on it, though, and not much swing back in, and Amla waves his wand of a bat at it - it's a diagonal bat, but does it matter when he connects so cleanly? - and sends it racing away through cover point

Henry to du Plessis, 2 runs, ooh, that's a good ball. Full, fuller than half-volley length, and it swings away late from just outside off. Du Plessis was looking for a drive through mid-on, and he ended up opened up and edging thickly to the left of third man, where Lockie Ferguson makes a good attempt at a diving save. Looks like he's juuust kept it in with a strong swish of his left hand

Faf du Plessis finished the 2015 World Cup with an average of 36. He's bulked that up to 46 now thanks to a really good last four years. In that time, he's even made public a wish to move from a good player to a great player and that's the focus whenever he trains.

Boult to Amla, no run, Ooh, that's some sharp inswing. A fullish length, and once again Amla's front foot goes nowhere. Tries to flick it hurriedly, following the swing, but his front pad is in the way. No appeal - the impact was outside leg stump and the ball was missing leg too

A wide gully in place now for Boult. No slips.

Henry to Amla, 3 runs, full, angling into off stump. Amla looks for the cover drive, a hands shot with feet going nowhere. The ball doesn't swing this time - he's playing for swing - and it runs away through midwicket off the inside edge. Big gap between bat and pad - that could easily have gone through

Boult to du Plessis, 2 runs, gets a full one first up, outside off, and he gets a good stride out to drive with an open face to the left of extra-cover. Big mix-up between the batsmen - not sure when exactly, because the TV pictures are a complete muddle - but Faf dives and makes his ground in time to beat his throw to the keeper

Faf du Plessis walks in at No. 3.

Boult to Kock, OUT, bowled him, stumps flying all over the place! He's been looking for that full one angling in towards leg stump all through the over, and he bowls another. De Kock leaves a bit of a hole in his attempted on-drive - the result of his front foot not really getting forward at all - and the ball simply bursts through. Judging by how the rest of the over's gone, a definite plan from Boult - something to do with de Kock's lack of feet movement early on, and maybe the angle that his bat comes down at, from around gully or thereabouts
