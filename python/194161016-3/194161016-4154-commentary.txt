Coming back to the appeal in the previous over, Afghanistan may have just had Latham had they had a review. Came back as all three reds. I'd mentioned an inside-edge but the spike was of the bat hitting the flap of the pad at the time the ball thudded in. Gulbadin's burned review has denied them a wicket

Raju Bairishett: "What is the point of having one of the best bowlers in the world and not using quickly when the target is small. Really, Rashid khan is not used properly by the team". For the late arrivals, Rashid was hit in the helmet with a Lockie Ferguson delivery in the first innings and has been ruled out of the match with a concussion. He never took the field.

Another little factoid about Hamid Hassan. In 2007, he played as an overseas amateur for Norden Cricket Club in Lancashire, once taking an eight-for in a league match when he was 20 years old. Having been noticed by a Norden club member on an MCC tour fixture against Afghanistan, Hassan became their designated overseas amateur because they had already contracted former Pakistan international Asif Mujtaba as their overseas pro. For those curious, Asif Mujtaba is now a USA national team selector having migrated to Dallas, Texas. Small, small world. We might see some appearances in the crowd from the Norden brigade when Afghanistan takes on England at Old Trafford later in this tournament.

Sam calls for a change at the top: "They really have to get Nicholls in for Munro.He seems incapable of getting past 20. It doesn't matter if they come quick, we need more as the top teams all have opening pairs who regularly have stands beyond the 100 run mark and against good bowling. Guptill has show in the past he is a true performer. Munro has yet to do so and has had plenty of chances."

Must say it was well worth a risk taking at this stage, but replays confirm there was no spike on snicko as the ball passed the bat. Williamson survives, onfield decision stays. Not out.

Ferguson to Aftab Alam, OUT, Aftab's adventurous stay ends. Identical shot to two balls earlier backing away to a short ball. That angle was going to keep producing top edges and sure enough this one is skied over the wicketkeeper towards third man.

Ferguson to Rashid Khan, OUT, brutal! Ferguson with a skiddy ball short of a length that has a touch of extra bounce at 138 kph/86 mph. Rashid came a step forward to defend but it climbs into his helmet and ricochets down onto the stumps. Kane Williamson, his captain at Sunrisers, comes over to put his arm around Rashid and check on him as the champion leggie is shaken up. Physio is out on field to escort him off as his eyes start bulging.

de Grandhomme to Ikram Alikhil, OUT, sucker ball claims Alikhil at backward point! Attempted wide yorker outside off just pitches before Alikhil drives hard, but Alikhil's back knee dips instead of getting on top of the ball to be able to drive this into the ground. Instead he slices under it and it flutters like a peaceful dove toward Guptill at backward point, taken on his haunches at chest height with fingers pointed to the sky.

Henry went short on off stump to Alikhil, who fended at it with an angled bat leaping off his toes. It clipped the edge and flew high to Taylor at slip, he hopped in the air and reached high over his head with his right hand but could only manage to parry it away to third man.

S Rajesh, our stats editor chimes in: In the first 25 overs, Afghanistan have played 98 dot balls (0 runs off the ball, including extras). That's the second-highest in the tournament so far in the first 25 overs of an innings. The highest was also by them - 102 against Australia. So while they have hit 16 fours and a six in the first 25 - which is joint third-highest in the tournament so far - they just haven't been able to rotate the strike enough

4.04pm Still overcast on one side, sunshine on the other and the players are back out in the middle. The umpires are not happy with the ball, so Aleem Dar signals to the fourth umpire who comes out with the box of balls.

Daanish Rashid: "Sorry Stef, I'm going to have to completely disagree with you there. I would go as far as to say that Williamson is possibly the best captain at this World Cup. He reads the conditions perfectly (2016 T20 WC is a great example of this) and this World Cup he's been magnificent as well. NZ's recent success is due to him."

Over in Cardiff, Bangladesh are taking a safety-first approach in a mammoth chase against England. Join Miller on commentary.

William Davies: "Tucked up at home over here in NZ in Dunedin (3am I must add!) with the family in the living room, hoping this rain stays away! Go the black caps!"

3.56pm Start at 4.05pm . No overs lost.

Ajay: "With regard to the Asghar fiasco- I agree that he isn't the greatest bat in the side, but his burning yet subdued passion as a leader has taken the side to new heights over the last two years, and they have gelled well under his captaincy. It was shocking to shake up the apple cart just before the start of such an important tournament, and its bad foreshadowing going forward- we've seen too many subcontinental teams torn apart by cricket boards and CEO's driven by big egos and power trips."

Stef is quite annoyed: "So frustrated yet again by Williamson's captaincy. Guy is a great batsman, but captain not so much. Firstly you leave Henry on when he is getting smashed to all parts. Then Afghanistan lose 4/5 and you bring on de grandhomme? What the heck? Bring back Boult and finish this off. He is so conservative!"

3.50pm The covers are coming off, we aren't far away from a resumption.

A small transcript of a mini-discussion between Peter, who has covered enough Afghanistan cricket, and I:

Shashank: Do you think Asghar Afghan has been given a raw deal? 

PDP: well, he wasn't doing anything special to merit keeping his spot as of late, but this is a classic situation where absence makes the heart grow fonder 

Shashank: Is there anyone who is missing from the squad but deserved to make it, according to you? 

PDP: Batting-wise, curious they've gone for Ali Khil to replace Shahzad instead of Shafiqullah Shafaq, valuing pure gloveman in Ali Khil over an attacking keeper-bat in Shafaq. Batting options otherwise are fairly slim. Usman Ghani, Javed Ahmadi haven't done much since last World Cup 

Shashank: Ikram is a good pick, plays conventional cricket and is more an accumulator than a dasher, the kind Afghanistan need. 

PDP: yeah, I vaguely remember him at that event. Him and Mujeeb were standouts.

3.39pm The umbrellas are out as well. Taylor has both hands folded at slip as the wind blows across the ground. The umpires converge and they are calling for the covers. Nabi and Williamson, who have played a lot of cricket together at Sunrisers Hyderabad, have a laugh as they walk off the field. Do note, they didn't necessarily run off the field. So that's perhaps an indication that it wasn't hosing down. There's stiff breeze though, which brings with it hope that the clouds will blow away soon.

Play about to resume in Taunton. Time for me to give way to Shashank Kishore.

Ashmal Khot: "Afghanistan should consider opening the batting with Rashid once in this world cup, I remember he opened once in World Cup qualifiers". Interesting suggestion. Not the worst idea in the world. Though the Powerplay was not the problem today. From 61/0 in 10 to 70 for 4.

Meanwhile in Paris, Dominic Thiem has advanced to the French Open final for the second straight year after upsetting No. 1 Novak Djokovic in an epic semi-final.

3.20 pm The word from Andrew Fernando at the ground is play will restart in 10 minutes at 3.30 pm. No overs lost. Play stopped for less than a half-hour so there's plenty of leeway left even for another delay later on.

3.13 pm Rain has stopped. The covers are being peeled back from the bowler's run-ups. Umpires back out on the field to have a look at the square. The pitch rolling cover is still in place over the 22 yards though.

The bowler's runups and the rest of the square are left unprotected for now. Could just be a passing shower. But a very intense one. And just as I say that the bigger tarps are being escorted out onto the field to cover the run-ups at the very least.

3.04 pm And out of nowhere a nasty shower has come down on the field. The umbrellas are out and the players are scurrying away off the field. Only the pitch is covered at the moment.

The ball flies in the air toward the point sweeper Munro, who charges in 12 yards and takes this at chest height while crouching down. Zazai taps his helmet with the bat. Soaring like an eagle at the start, his wings have been clipped by Neesham.
