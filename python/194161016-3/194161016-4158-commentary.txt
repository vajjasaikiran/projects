Holder to Stokes, FOUR runs, fuller ball, and he has whipped this through midwicket to seal the win. Root and Stokes give each other a hug, as they should. This has been an overall professional performance from the hosts, and that has certainly lifted the gloom from all the washouts over the last week or so at this World Cup!

Joe Root and Moeen Ali are now the only English players to score centuries and take two or more wickets in a World Cup match

Holder to Stokes, (no ball) FOUR runs, short, and he forces this off the front foot, past mid off. Pretty amazing shot, when you consider where he placed this one!

Target under 10, as Holder comes on

sam: "Watching WI play these days is a punishment. I feel bad for the people who spent the money to watch them get spanked. Sad state of affair for WI and Pakistan. " --- They haven't been good today, but they certainly sparkled early on in this World Cup. Would hope they can get that mojo going again

Gabriel to Woakes, OUT, dug in short, and he holes out to long leg! Woakes couldn't help himself as that was pitched short and asked for the pull. Top edge carries it just a little short of long leg, and substitute fielder Fabian Allen running in takes a good, low catch!

This mistake is already discussed in earlier comments. Secondly, they should've chased this total as fast as possible, because it will have a big impact on NRR which will be so vital. Maybe they could've brought Buttler first, no? However, despite all this, Well Done Team England!" --- To be fair, you win enough games, you don't need to worry about net run rate

By and large, players don't consider personal landmarks as important as team wins, though

Thanks Andrew. If there were any doubts about England's status as World Cup favourites, they are laying them to rest with a comprehensive victory here. Just need to keep track of the fitness of their players, though

Tom McGuirk: "Re: Batters being hit on the helmets. I think helmets give them a false sense of security. If I remember rightly, that Aussie who died showed a weakness to short pitched bowling in his early career. He came to England to play county cricket ahead of one Ashes tour to practice against it. Would he have played the fatal shot if he hadn't had a helmet. I would agree that poor technique is also a factor." --- Not sure if the Phil Hughes incident has affected batsmen since. Might be an interesting one for the stats guys to see

Root to Hetmyer, OUT, there's the breakthrough! Joe Root was brought on for this express purpose, and he plucks the return catch as Hetmyer miscues a simple drive down the ground. The ball may have gripped a bit, but it just popped straight back up towards the non-striker, and Root gleefully accepts this, and celebrates like Botham did with his little jig in 1992. The partnership comes to an end 11 short of getting to three figures!

Wood to Pooran, no run, short and sharp, through to the keeper. England are in a dominant position all of a sudden

MAB: "So when I was reading about this last wicket of Gayle, I just being booked by a traffic cop to use a mobile phone while driving. I thought the law said if you are talking on the phone and not following Cricinfo on your phone." Cool story bro. Remind me to avoid you like the plague on the Motorway!

Kosheen: "WI lose hope and Hope." Here's Shimron, he can thump it. Curiously, the Gayle wicket took just eight runs off West Indies' predicted total, according to Forecaster. The Hope wicket sets it back by 59 runs. 229 is the new expectation.

Wood to Hope, OUT, massive appeal! Wood thinks that's stone-dead! No response from umpire Dharmasena, but England review. It was angling in on a very full length. If there was no inside edge that's going to be close. Hope was playing round his front pad, and yep, that is smashing leg stump! A fine review from England and a sudden flurry of wickets. Hope's torturous innings is ended, just when he might have been getting settled.

Plunkett to Gayle, OUT, there he goes! Takes on the short ball, but it's a long old boundary, even for Gayle! Bairstow has a long, long time to consider his life choices as the ball plops into his hands, and that is a very, very big wicket...
