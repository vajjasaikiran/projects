Shagun Segan : "We all love the Afganistan team and the whole story about their fight and grit. But then you cant help but think which other team would have been a better prospect for this WC? Also wouldnt it make more sense to have the qualifiers in the host country, so that we know which is the best team to play in these conditions? Playing in Africa and qualifying for UK just seems wrong. It can work for sports that are not dependent on the field, but for cricket you need to play the team for the pitch." Certainly looked peculiar at the time to have the 2018 Qualifier in Zimbabwe, particularly considering that the 2014 World Cup Qualifier was held in New Zealand.

Shakib Al Hasan to Mohammad Nabi, OUT, Bangladesh's king of the tourney castles the President of Afghanistan! It was a beauty flighted on fourth stump and skidded on with Nabi's technique exposed. He gave a half-hearted stride forward prodding with a gap between bat and pad. The ball clips the inside edge before ricocheting onto leg stump. Shakib is rocking this tournament!

Shakib Al Hasan to Gulbadin Naib, OUT, brilliant field placing captaincy by Mashrafe! They had a man at short mid-off a little while ago and Liton was moved a touch wider at short extra cover at about 17 yards. The ball has been stopping a touch on this pitch all day with flicks and drives going slightly uppish in the ring and on this occasion Gulbadin laces a flat drive to Liton, who claims a catch at ankle height crouching slightly forward. Shakib erupts, as does the partisan Bangladesh crowd! 8/10 on degree of difficulty due to the pace it came at Liton from short range but it was straight to him on line.

Mosaddek Hossain to Hashmatullah Shahidi, OUT, lovely flight and lovely stumping! Hashmatullah had itchy feet from the start of the over with a series of premeditated shuffles down the pitch. He got the itch again tempted out with a well flighted ball that was dragged slightly back and slightly wider on a fifth stump line. Hashmatullah doesn't cover the line and is beaten by the turn. Sharp work by Mushfiqur to whip the bails off with Hashmatullah's back foot flailing about three inches short of getting back in.

Both he and Gulbadin stopped midpitch to admire the scenery on the boundary. Mehidy backs up the misfield from point with Gulbadin still halfway down the pitch after Hashmatullah ran back. But he rushed the throw to Mosaddek over the stumps and dragged him two yards away to reprieve Gulbadin. An accurate relay would have had him out by 3 yards. Mosaddek is furious at Mehidy.

Thanks Varun. Afghanistan remember are playing their second match in three days so some of the physical struggles are sort of understandable with Gulbadin and Hashmatullah both getting their legs massaged here to spark the early drinks break.

Meanwhile, here's a nugget from Isam at the ground for you to chew on: "Bangladesh team are currently in a long team talk during the drinks break. There seems to be a bit of nervousness with Afghanistan having gone 16 overs with just one wicket down."

Shakib Al Hasan to Rahmat Shah, OUT, taken at mid-on. That is a soft dismissal for Afghanistan's best player. Length ball skids on with the arm at off stump. He looks to pull uppishly with the front leg in the leg side. Ends up slicing weakly for the fielder tracking back there

Gulbadin Naib to Mosaddek Hossain, OUT, slower ball yorker finally rewarded! It was loopy at 99 kph/61 mph. Mosaddek backed away to carve over the off side but couldn't time this trying to swat over the top of it as the ball fell off a table. Toe edge drags the ball onto off stump.

Gulbadin Naib to Mohammad Saifuddin, 1 run, dropped! Frankly embarrassing from Dawlat. The same man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 26 on the boundary off Rashid in the England match produces the worst effort of the day - and there are plenty to choose from across these 50 overs. Gorgeous slower ball from Gulbadin landing wide outside off is sliced softly in the air to backward point. Dawlat runs to his right in front of Asghar moving left from short third man. He spills a dolly at head height. 2/10 on degree of difficulty.

Mushfiqur has set up Bangladesh beautifully on a track offering plenty of turn. Every run valuable on what is expected to be a tough chasing track used for a second match.

Gulbadin Naib to Mahmudullah, OUT, another slower ball does the trick! Full marks to Gulbadin for the constant variations which stymied both batsmen this over. This one lands on a good length on the stumps but Mahmudullah's timing is off trying to charge and he mistimes a pull straight to Nabi five yards in from the ring at midwicket, taken at thigh height while crouching his left knee on the turf.

Bangladesh retain their review, but they've lost Sarkar - who already looked quite lost at No. 5. Liton was probably pushed up today to counter Mujeeb, and we've seen why

Inconclusive evidence should favour the batting team; I thought that's the rule? I am pretty sure if it hadn't been for that soft signal, it would not have been given out by Dar."

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Liton Das, OUT, full on off, drives in the air to short cover and Afghanistan are claiming a catch! Watching live I thought it definitely short hopped and Liton is standing his ground. Hashmatullah Shahidi is the fielder. It's 50/50. He lunged forward and the ball lodged in his right hand with his left hand coming off. His head was up high, didn't look at the ball going in to protect his face so he may genuinely not have known if it carried or not. And the third umpire has decided it is OUT! Third umpire is Aleem Dar. The soft signal on field was out and he said he didn't see anything conclusive to overturn on the mic'd up conversation. Those kinds of catches are regularly overturned. It'll generate plenty of debate for sure. It looked a(wk)ward at any rate as both hands were not under the ball, just the right one.

Dawlat Zadran to Tamim Iqbal, FOUR runs, nearly! Tamim has had trouble keeping the ball on the ground early in his innings. Another drive uppishly toward mid-off but Asghar Afghan is lead-footed and more or less falls over trying to flail his arms at it. Never came close to getting a hand to it whereas a more agile fielder might have created a chance.

ESPNcricinfo's readers can now watch the game LIVE on Hotstar. If you're in India, click here. Readers in the US can click here. Take your pick. Bish and friends vs. PDP and Shetty. Decisions decisions....

Ian Bishop, who was on the TV call at Old Trafford on Saturday for West Indies v New Zealand, has hustled down to Southampton to do the toss proceedings. Yours truly was also in the stands as a paying spectator in Stand C6 right above the West Indies dressing room at Old Trafford and now I'm on ball-by-ball for this match today. This obviously means you are in for a cracker today (I'll happily settle for 1% credit to Bish's 99% magic-making).

For those confused *raises hand*, start of play has been delayed to 10.40 am by virtue of toss happening at 10.10 am. Not sure why the 10 minutes can't be made up between the toss to keep the start on time at 10.30. But anyway.

Jess: "Why Afghanistan keep dropping Aftab is beyond me. I can understand replacing Zazai with Shinwari but replacing your best seamer with a guy who has gone at more than 7 an over in this World Cup makes no sense whatsoever."

As for Bangladesh, two changes in their XI. Mosaddek Hossain and Mohammad Saifuddin are in for Rubel Hossain and Sabbir Rahman. Mashrafe Mortaza says he doesn't mind batting first because this is a used wicket, same pitch from the India v Afghanistan match.

10.10 am Toss time... Gulbadin Naib calls tails... and it's tails. Afghanistan will bowl first, possibly with DLS in mind in context of rain. Hazratullah Zazai and Aftab Alam have been left out. Dawlat Zadran recalled and... Samiullah Shinwari to play his first match of the tournament. A blast from the past. We'll see if he has anything left in the tank after being one of Afghanistan's key allrounders from 2010-2016. Hazratullah being bumped out means Rahmat Shah will move up to open with Gulbadin. So both openers from the start of the tournament - Hazratullah and Mohammad Shahzad - are now out of the picture.

Kartik: "Expect a few words on the field today between both the teams, especially after Naib's comment about taking Bangladesh down with them"

The past few days have had an upset and a series of cracking close encounters, and you'd hope that continues to be the case. Our latest Talking World Cup podcast episode looked back at all of that, including the story of Mohammad Nabi the hustler who almost pulled off a miracle for Afghanistan the other day (you can also listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts here). What better way to pass any rain delay than downloading it and listening to my brother from another mother Srinath Sripath! He's joined for a chat by Alan Gardner and world-famous debut author (and sometimes Sri Lanka correspondent) Andrew Fidel Fernando.

9.57 am Another rapid fire update from Isam. Toss delayed by 10 minutes. Expected at 10:10 am.

Speaking of Isam, he's just put a dampener on the morning buildup sending a note from the ground that it is currently drizzling in Southampton and that a "toss is unlikely to happen on time." Covers are on the square at the moment.

Mohd Irshad: "Read the article how Bangladesh winning games and Fans. This will surely inspire many young talent to do better and help Bangladesh be powerful cricket playing nation. Its need of the hour considering how pridictable this WC has been where we know who who would be our top 4 befor event at mid of it." In case you missed it, here's our main main Mohammad Isam's story on the diaspora rallying behind the Tigers all around the UK at this event.

Karan: "I am all but baffled by the scheduling.....Afg had a match on Saturday and another one today! That seems toooo tight." Considering some teams have had a week off between matches at this event, you'll get plenty of people who agree with you Karan.

Afghanistan take the field today in one of the shortest turnarounds at the World Cup, less than 48 hours after taking India down to the wire in an 11-run loss at Southampton. Meanwhile, Bangladesh have had three days off to reflect on a valiant fight against Australia that included an unbeaten hundred from Mushfiqur Rahim. Will Afghanistan's spinners trouble the Bangladesh order as much as they did India on this same ground on Saturday? Or can a sizzling Shakib help close the gap with England for the fourth slot on the points table. Ankur Dhawan sets the scene here.

9.30 am Good morning, great morning, spectacular morning on day 26 of the Cricket World Cup! Peter Della Penna here kicking off the commentary today for Afghanistan v Bangladesh at Southampton and I'll be joined throughout the day by Varun Shetty. Afghanistan have already been eliminated from contention for the knockout stage but Bangladesh are still in the hunt for a semi-final berth. However, Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib let it be known at the pre-match press conference that if Afghanistan are drowning, they plan to take the Tigers down with them as the two teams renew their young albeit intense rivalry.
