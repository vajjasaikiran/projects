5.40pm: After 47 games in the 2019 World Cup, there's the small matter of one more at Lord's on Sunday. It's a game that will be shown free-to-air in the UK, too, live on Channel 4 [everyone at the ECB breathes a huge sigh of relief]. It's coming home - well, it's coming to the Home of Cricket, at least. Can England complete the job and lift their first World Cup, or will it be the Blackcaps breaking English hearts along with their own duck? Either way, you can follow it all with us. For now, it's goodbye from myself and Deiva, as well as Miller and Al on the Live Report. Thanks for getting involved. Cheerio!


5.25pm: Time for the captains, starting with Aaron Finch: "Totally outplayed today, the way they had us 27 for 3 after ten set the tone. You expect the new ball to come on on any surface, they bowled a great length. Still a lot of positives to take out of the World Cup campaign, we've come a long way since the last time we were in England. You always want to win, you come thinking you can win, but there have been positives, even the last six months, lot of backs to the wall and a lot of character on show. But it still hurts. [England start with bat] We tried to change it up, looking for wicket-taking options. They played exceptionally well, we know how dynamic, dominating they are. One of those days, we didn't execute as we could have and you get hurt by a good team. [Loss to SA meant Edgbaston semi] You've got to beat everyone, so can't read too much into that. We came here with a couple injuries but that's not an excuse. Came wanting to win but it wasn't to be."

England captain Eoin Morgan: "Absolutely delighted. We'd like to thank the fans, unbelievable support, Edgbaston has been very kind to us and no doubt people at home, too. To be honest, having beaten India at this ground, we'd have come here with similar confidence, taken the momentum from the group stages. We talk about getting better and better, we set the tone from ball one and got on top. [Woakes?] Extremely happy, he's a cool customer, goes about his business day in day out exceptionally he's one of the best in the first ten overs, him and Jofra were outstanding and the guys backed that up, which allowed us to stay on top. [Roy innings] Him and Jonny at the top are quite imposing. They are in the form of their life, if they can get themselves in great, it sets the tone for us. [Last WC final appearance] I was six, I don't remember much, seen the highlights so we watch it a lot. [Lord's on Sunday] It's an opportunity, a huge one at that. Looking back to where we were in 2015, it's a dramatic improvement. Everyone in the dressing room can take credit. We want to make the most of the opportunity."

5.15pm: We are going to see a new name on cup... Australia's reign is over, defeated in a World Cup semi-final for the first time. New Zealand await, but England will celebrate for now - in fact there are fireworks going off at Edgbaston. I wonder if they would have been used for an Australia win? It's actually started chucking it down, but nothing can rain on England's parade; they've won a World Cup knockout game for the first time since 1992, the tournament which also marked their last appearance in the final.

Chris Woakes is named Man of the Match: "Pretty speechless actually, incredible performance from the team, starting with the bowling and the way the guys finished that off was outstanding. There were some nerves around, a few anxious people in the dressing room - that's natural in the semi-finals of a major tournament. The way we produced the goods showed how good we are and how we perform as a team. [First ball hit for four?] I just got my length wrong, got a little bit full and a world-class player like Warner is going to put it away. Got my length right and felt good after that. [Important to get early wickets?] Yeah, I don't think it was a bad wicket by any means and when you get wickets at the top they have to rebuild, and we kept the pressure on. We got off to a flyer chasing a relatively small total and that's probably the difference. [Criticism after Lord's Australia defeat] We try not to look at what people are saying, could have bowled fuller at Lord's, but we've had momentum from playing two good games against India and New Zealand and carried it on today. [First final since 1992] It probably hasn't sunk in, to win in the fashion we have against Australia on the best ground in the world is incredible and really looking forward to Sunday."

Well, then. That is barely a fighting score, but Australia aren't your regular brawlers. Can they do a New Zealand and upset the odds against a big-scoring opponent? They have twice defended lower totals to progress in World Cup semi-finals (although, unlike in 1999, a tie might not be enough). One thing we can be clear on: the first 10 overs here are crucial. Trevor Bayliss said a few days ago that his team weren't scared of chasing. What about the England fans out there? Nervous, much?

Rashid to Stoinis, OUT, googly, hit on the knee roll... GIVEN! Australia have no reviews! Was it high? The ball actually hit the thigh pad, skidding on inside a woolly waft from Stoinis, and after an age Dharmasena's finger went up! Smith gives a look of anguish at the non-striker's end as Stoinis heads off. Might well have been umpire's call - but what a call that was!

Rehan Yousaf: "I recall the CWC-1996 Semi-final at Mohali, where Australia batted first against the West Indies. Top order was dismantled cheaply by the opening West Indian bowlers. Aussie batsman Stuart Law played a big hand and had taken the total score past 200 in that match. The same scenario replicates in that game. Can Steve Smith take this ship to behest a memorable knock?"

So nasty that it detaches Carey's helmet. 86mph, Carey looks away, ducks into it, cops it on the chin area, and the helmet flies off. Carey is bleeding and gets some treatment on his chin in the middle. The ball just about bounced over the stumps. Tense faces in the Australia change room. Remember, Harmison v Ponting?

Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch

Zameer Arif: "Last time Australia's top order collapsed, team were struggling. England can go for that. and New Zealand showed yesterday how to do it. There is no bits and pieces player to anchor them either."


10.25am Morning, ladies and gents. Thanks for the boos warm welcome Alan. I'm all warmed up. Australia and England players walk out with the mascots. Warner has a word with one of the kids. Time for the national anthems. First-up is Advance Australia Fair followed by God Save the Queen. Right, a spot in the final is on the line. Are you reaaaaaaady?


WATCH LIVE ON HOTSTAR - For Indian viewers only


10.20am: Osman reports on the atmosphere at Edgbaston: "More boos for Smith and Warner than there were cheers for England (or other Australian) players as the teams were announced at the stadium." There we go, they've set their stall out. And speaking of stalls to set out, it's time to welcome Deivarayan Muthu for his first spell of the day...

10.15am: Looks like a hard, oatmeal-coloured surface in use for today's semi-final. Good toss to win? A graveyard for bowlers? We'll soon find out. Australia's strength has been built on the gun-slinging qualities of openers Finch and David Warner (1100-plus runs between them)... but just as New Zealand proved yesterday, early wickets can dramatically alter preconceptions.

Here's Billy, on the conundrum of Australia's misfiring middle order (which has got them this far, to be fair): "Surely Carey has to bat above Stoinis and Maxwell regardless of the situation. Those two have offered very little through the tournament "

"Following up on the article regarding the sale of tickets, how much of the ground is full right now?" Well, Sahil, George Dobell says it is "much quieter than you would expect for an India game", no horns, vuvuzelas, etc but we don't yet know how many will come through the turnstiles

"Yes Shankar. Australia tied the 1999 semi-final with South Africa to proceed to the Final where they easily won against Pakistan at Lords." Good work, Ali. I think I've dug it out

10.07am: First blood to Australia? Or can England break the chasing hoodoo...? Have your say on the Live Report and then it's over to the Match Day team for all their pre-match build-up via our live stream


10.02am: Australia win the toss and bat, Aaron Finch and his men will get first use of the pitch. Just one change, with Peter Handscomb coming in for the injured Usman Khawaja. Finch reckons the pitch looks pretty good, but won't change too much. Eoin Morgan admits he would have also batted, but shrugs off his luck. "Not really bothered, before the World Cup we preferred to chase," he says. England as expected are unchanged.

England: 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler ((wk)), 7 Chris Woakes, 8 Liam Plunkett, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood

Australia: 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 David Warner, 3 Steven Smith, 4 Peter Handscomb, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Alex Carey ((wk)), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Jason Behrendorff

10am: Toss time at Edgbaston, unlucky country for Australia. Can Finch get them off on the right foot?

"Any word on the location of the pitch today? Have they gone for the fun of a pitch right on the edge again, or is it a more standard somewhere in the middle kind of thing today?" It's more towards the centre, Matt. So that short boundary shouldn't be such an issue

"Howdy, Alan," chirps SRS, "Indian fan here. As much a heartbreak that was yesterday, here's hoping Sunday would be a battle of potential first time winners. No nerves!"

9.55am: Mark Wood has just received a commemorative cap for his 50th ODI. We've mentioned Starc, but England have a couple of genuine quicks these days, in Wood and Jofra Archer, who have played a big part in their success at this tournament. But who's going to run the Fast Show today?

"Morning Alan. Gosh this is soooo nerve wracking and we are only awaiting the toss!!!!!! What will I be like during the game??" Just imagine if England do get to the final, Rob...

And here's the Indian view, from Balu: "As an India supporter would like to see England playing NZ in Finals......let World Cup get a place in New Country......."

Shankar: "Technically Aus have only won 6/7 semis, they tied one. Anyone remember that game?" Hmmm, rings a bell. Did someone get run out?

9.45am: We do, of course, have a reserve day for this semi, though the game isn't being played in Manchester, to we'll probably be all right (sorry, Gnasher). As well as some dodgy weather, and the difficulty chasing, this has also been the World Cup of the yorker. Mitchell Starc, anyone?

"Any word on the pitch yet? Are we to assume that the captain that wins the toss will opt to bat first as seems to be the trend in this WC?" George reckons it will be a belter, Dean, but won't deteriorate too much. Let's hope the Sage of Edgbaston is right

Here's Dave Fern: "Can't wait for the toss and the match to get started. Really hope England can show up today, bat first and get off to a flying start. Australia are a tough team to face, but England can definitely beat them on a good day."

"This will be game of the century. Two old rivals meeting in semis. Did they ever meet before in semi?" Oh dear, Imran. Don't ask Gary Gilmour that question

9.35am: We're a little under half an hour from the toss - which could be crucial, given how important a score on the board has become (the first semi-final now being exhibit A). England seem likely to field a settled side, but Australia have already been forced to call in Peter Handscomb... and there's some talk Maxwell could miss out for Matt Wade, too. (I know!) Anyway, we've also got the Live Report up and running, so you can get a dual serving of World Cup fever.

"Can you please stop banging on about who has won what in previous world cups? It's entirely irrelevant unless you have the same players - which we don't." Nervous, Ryan?

Steve is also on a history-means-nothing trip: "You say we haven't won a knockout game since 1992... apart from the last 2 group stage games were essentially knockout matches..."

"England deserve to be favourites," muses Spencer. "BUT the weight of expectations might undo them. India would understand this." Indeed. Any India fans out there today? [Ducks behind sofa]

Feedback of the day, from PAUL CLEMENTS: "This World Cup would be done and dusted for England if only the Selectors had had the presence of mind to select Darren Stevens!! His feats with the ball this season for Kent are amazing. Perhaps he'll get a look in at the next one?"

9.25am: Okay, okay. What's the gut saying? This is pretty uncharted territory for England - while 1992 was within memory for some of us, it feels several lifetimes ago in cricketing terms. Australia, by contrast, are used to this. They've played knifey-spoony before. They've peaked at the right time and are gunning to set up a repeat of the 2015 final. Can England's mean machine find top gear or are Australia going to stick a spanner in the works?

"So excited about this one," yelps Cris R, "and if England win today, in their last three matches they will have defeated each of the other semi-finalists...not too shoddy!"

And here's Luke Hill: "So after volunteering at Old Trafford and meeting up with some of the cricinfo faithful, I'm back here in Berlin working away this morning. Luckily the Indian and Kiwi contingent got to watch their final yesterday, so as the token brit in the office, I get to watch the game today whilst ~working~ cheering on"

9.15am: Okay, time to get some preview content in front of your peepers, starting with our semi-final tactics board. We have also got George Dobell on the importance of England winning a trophy to go with the plaudits (carpe ODI-em, essentially); and Osman Samiuddin has been ruminating on fantasy cricketer Glenn Maxwell and England's under-the-radar hard-yards-merchant Liam Plunkett, the fast bowler you don't want to be. He's a thoughtful man, Os. We've also got the complete stats breakdown on what makes YJB and J-Roy so good.

Here's Qasim: "In the last world cup one semi-final was a thriller and the other was one sided, this time around we already have had a thriller yesterday, hoping that history doesn't repeat and this is also a thriller."

"According to the list of world cup finals on Wikipedia, India have already won this world cup," hoots Mitch. "Can't wait to see how they pull it off!" I'm sure the BCCI have got something up their sleeve

9.05am: First things first, here's our Birmingham local guide, George Dobell, with an update from the ground: "Morning from Edgbaston. Lovely morning it is, too. Much brighter than expected. Forecast a bit better, too." The jewel of the midlands sparkling - who would ever suggest otherwise?

"Is it sad that I have been refreshing this page whilst at work since about half 8 waiting for the hour and a half of live text build up to start? I am just too excited. I can't function." It's okay, Paddles, we're here now. No need to be functional, other than to occasionally press refresh

9am: Morning, folks. Is it coming home, or is it going on an all-expenses-paid trip to the antipodes? Today we'll get a bit closer to finding out. Six weeks after England kicked off their tournament at The Oval, things are about to get properly crunchy for the hosts. New England versus old masters Australia, in a titanic dust-up to take on India New Zealand in the final. England, who haven't won a knockout match since 1992 (and haven't beaten Australia at the World Cup in the intervening period, either), against Australia, who've won seven WC semi-finals out of seven (not to mention picked up the trophy five times). The first semi-final gave us a two-dayer for the ages, but what has Brum got in store for us? Fill up that mug of rosy lea and kick back with a read of our preview, because we're about to find out...
