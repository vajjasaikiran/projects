7:45pm And that is all! Thanks for joining us through the day. Good night.


Sarfraz: The crowd is always behind the Pakistan team. Thank you very much. Fielding is a very important part. Unfortunately we didn't do well in the previous matches. We practiced hard. The way we played today, it was a great team effort. All the bowlers did really well and in the end Babar and Haris - one of the finest batting I've ever seen. We knew 240 was not an easy target on this pitch. We just wanted to bat 50 overs. Credit to Babar and Haris, the way they played on this pitch. [On 1992] when the World Cup starts, people think that way. But we're not thinking like that. Our focus is the next match. We are very confident and hopefully we'll do well.


Williamson: We've seen it in our last three games, where the surfaces have offered to the bowlers and made life difficult. We were outplayed by a strong Pakistan side. I think there was a little bit more bounce than we experienced on the same surface we played the other day. The fight that was shown in the middle and back end was good, to get us in a position where we were competitive. But that partnership with Babar and Haris, they took it from us. [Shadab] yeah it was nice wasn't it? We tried to soak it up. Thought if we get 230-250, there was a chance. And there was, but they soaked up the pressure and played really nicely. When the threat is spin, especially when the wicket became a lot slower, we were trying to get anybody in there who would rotate the ball. There's so many games in the round robin that you're not expecting to win them all. There's things we need to iron out. We'll have to adapt a little better than we did today.


Babar: This is my best innings. the wicket was difficult and turned a lot in the second half. The plan was to go through to the end and give my 100%. When we started, the plan was to see out Ferguson. But when Santner came on, the plan became not to give wickets to him and cover up later when the fast bowlers come on. The fans support us here in Birmingham, it's great. 


Babar Azam is the Man of the Match.


7:30pm Edgbaston explodes and the Pakistan players rush onto the field. They've copped an absolute truckload of criticism and been written off, but a comprehensive win over South Africa and a clinical one over NZ today have seen them storm back into contention!

Don't write them off just yet. They are one point behind England and level with Bangladesh. A mature chase, shepherded by a young man with a head far wiser than his 24 years would suggest. NZ suffer their first defeat of the 2019 World Cup, and their first group stage defeat in 8 years.

Mickey Arthur runs down the changing room with an arm around Shaheen Afridi, a wide grin on his face. His team is not going down without a fight, and that is all he;s asked of them.

John Geddam: "Is Kane bowling only because it's turning and not regularly?!... I mean.... He's doing a decent job than most other spinners" --- To be fair, John, Hafeez might have got away with that shot on another pitch.

Ash: "I think NZ can still take this home if they take couple of wickets here. For that fast bowlers need to bowl into the pitch, which hasn't happen."

Usman: "This is classic Pakistan. Most dangerous batsman? Not Williamson, not Taylor, not Latham, but Neesham and Grandhomme. Most dangerous bowler? Not Bout, but Williamson."

Drinks break. Thank goodness. Get all your breathing done, folks.

Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, bouncer hits him on the grille. 142kph. Ferguson's had enough of the short ball that doesn't rise up. This is banged in, a proper bouncer. And Hafeez is swiping hopefully from under it. Flush in the grille. He's on his feet though

Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, oh beautiful. Another short ball at waist height. Not too different in line from the one he punched through point, but this time he's swiveled and used the angle to find the long leg boundary. Rolls the wrists on it to keep it down

A slip in place. Also a backward short leg. Hafeez having a word with the umpire about sight screen problems. A game of microseconds against Lockie, who has both the pace and that 'stache vying for your attention...looks like there's some sort of a concrete patch that isn't fully covered.

Ferguson to Imam-ul-Haq, OUT, Guptill you absolute monster! Big strides forward, big limbs reaching out, but the grace of a much smaller man as he dives and gets his fingers under this at point! And this following an absolute scorcher of a bouncer from Lockie, jumping up at Imam's grille from middle stump. Remember, he'd caused him problems in the UAE, even hit him on the head not so long ago. Goes straight for the bouncer option. Imam just fends at it with no clue and it pings off the shoulder of the bat. Just brutal fast bowling

Welcome back. Danyal here, and I'll take you through the first ten overs as Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq look to take Pakistan through that same period without too much drama. The bowlers have - largely - done their job, and Pakistan will be bitterly disappointed if they come up short here.

The players have started to make their way onto the field, with the start about five minutes away.

Kumar Suresh: "My friend here in Auckland who plays for a local club says, "we play on these sort of wickets day-in-day-out during the end of our season. I see no reason why we wont win this." he reminds me of 2011 wc against SA. Defending low totals is in the genes of NZ. They thrive on it"
##########

Burhan: "Well, I guess this is Good effort from NZ but at the toss Pakistan would happily get 237 at the end of First Innings :), Best of Luck Pakistan "

Syed: "NZ final score is more due to good sensible batting by 6th (wk)t partnership rather than poor bowling and poor fielding by Pakistan. Got to give credit where it is due...."

Anjan: "NZ not getting bowled out despite a big scare gives a soft signal of confidence to Pak fans about non existence of a monster in the pitch. Just a pressure handling game from now on I reckon "

Lakshman Kumar: "With Boult and Ferguson's good form, I feel NZ are 10-15 runs above par from the start they got..!"

Umer : "After getting Williamson, bringing back Imad waseem allowed De Grandhome and Neesham to set. Sarfraz needed to be more aggressive at that time."

Arif Hossain: "I have a feeling that Jimmy Neesham innings is going to be the decider tonight! "

Himash: "Jimmy Neesham did an Angelo Matthews today. Read the wicked and grinded it out to bring NZ to parity. Will be the decider. "

Jatin Goyal: "Irrespective of the result of today's game, NZ look a great team - 2 explosive openers, very stable 3 & 4, one wicket keeper batsman, 2 gritty allrounders, 4 good bowlers - perfectly balanced team on paper All they need is a belief that they can win the cup"

Ahsan: "It's not that hard to bat on i think pak will win in 43rd over inshallah "

imran: "50 runs of last 5 overs. pakistan need 238 to win. 85 runs in last 10 overs. once NZ were 83/5 n they managed to end as 237/6 6th wicket going down at 217. impressive comeback by NZ all rounders. neesham stayed not out 97. good luck pakistan"

SabbirChowdhury: "Neesham has missed his first ODI hundred by just three runs. And in the last over he scored 12 runs! All my sympathies!"


Meanwhile, there was delight for Bangladesh and despair for India in football today, as Dhaka Abahani reached the AFC Cup knockout stage at the cost of Chennaiyin FC in thrilling fashion. Debayan Sen, switching his attention to football today, describes how the drama unfolded.


3:20pm 'Once you realise you'll survive without the game, you'll enjoy it for what it is' - Jimmy Neesham's words talking about how he'd almost retired, partly because of missing out on the last World Cup. He found perspective, he found balance, and he finds himself at the end of a New Zealand innings that looked like it could have ended an hour ago. This is a top effort from him. Just a few short of a century, but he has kept New Zealand in the game along with Colin de Grandhomme. Kane Williamson was at it, doing the rescue briefly, but Pakistan had him early enough to cause some serious trouble. An epic show from them the first 30 overs, particularly from the two youngest bowlers in their line-up. They had New Zealand panicking. But we have some sort of parity now. 237 is by no means a scary total, and Mickey Arthur has just said he backs his batsmen to get it. But it is enough for New Zealand to come out more confident. I get the feeling we're in for a sensational game today.

Wahab Riaz to de Grandhomme, 1 run, OUT, this looks out. Run-out appeal sent upstairs. CDG walking off already. Guided a slower short ball to third man's left. Came back for a second that wasn't there. At least not for him. Sarfraz is in a poor position, right in front of the stumps, when he gathers this. But there's so much time to turn around, parry it onto the stumps and catch CDG short. A tame end to a very important innings

Shaheen Shah Afridi to Neesham, no run, yorker just outside off, looks to carve this through off side and is beaten on the inside edge. Pakistan have the faint idea that there's an edge on that. They don't review. But the umpires now have a discussion and they've sent it up...so they think he's got an edge. Soft signal is not out. Sarfraz took this quite low. 'Can't use Ultra Edge,' says the third umpire presumably because the bat is jamming into the turf as the ball passes it. So it will remain not out, without even going to the zoomer on whether that carried. Hang on. Now they're checking again... this one is possibly Pakistan's review. Not clear yet. But it does remain not out. Funnily, this time Ultra Edge IS used. Don't let anyone tell you they understand cricket in its entirety...

Shishank dahiya: "So now the fight is between england and the chasing pack. If india beat England on Sunday world cup will be on fire. " This match isn't over yet, folks. But if Pakistan get two points here, then, to quite a certain football manager, it will be "squeaky bum time" for the hosts

A flip on the angle and this is even closer...this is now about whether the umpire believes he's got the toe-end just behind the line. He thinks it has. Not out. That was sloppy of him to plonk the bat in like that. He'd poked this bouncer into the off side with soft hands. Shadab was down at it rapidly and throwing with barely any time to get himself balanced.

Shadab Khan to Williamson, OUT, has he got him? He's got him! Shadab Khan has done it! Length ball, dipping outside off and drawing Williamson forward. he stabs at it away from the body as it turns and gets big off the surface. A faint edge on it and keeper holds on. Lovely bowling but also uncharacteristically loose from Williamson, who was getting a bit weary outside off in the last 15-20 minutes. Still, it takes some doing to get him out there and Shadab has produced the perfect delivery. Just a lovely pace on that

I promise, no one's ever going to trust process if Pakistan get through at England's expense. One team's done everything right for four years, while the other has looked nowhere near that level for at least the past two. And the latter's threatens to pip the former to the last four. Amazing drama.

Muhammad Tahir: "I Know Kane's wicket is the key, but if Pak can keep getting wickets at the other end it would put pressure on him and make mistakes."

Javed Ghaffar: "Not Amir, Shaheen is the real Surprise !"

Nadeem : "Since when did Shaheen Shah Afridi turn into Magrath? "

Shaheen Shah Afridi to Latham, OUT, gone, this is much too good for Latham. Shaheen's on fire. Pitched on a length just outside off stump, and shapes away ever so slightly, taking the outside edge of Latham's bat as he attempts yet another defensive stroke. Never quite looked like getting a move on, and now New Zealand are four down. It might really be on!

11:28am Hello again! The anthems are done, with both captains flashing big smiles at the end of their respective anthems. A wholesome, G-rated start on a gloomy day. A match at last. Here we go. Guptil and Munro in the middle. Hafeez will start, to try and trouble Munro, no doubt.


And the anthems are about to start. For the first ten overs, here's Varun. Be good to him!




We're closing in on the action now. Anthems are just moments away, and following that, we should have live action for you. To recap, Pakistan need to win to have a realistic chance of qualifying, while New Zealand, most likely already through, will mathematically guarantee it with two points today.




Shakir: "I want to say Pakistan zindabad, can it be published " Why not?

New Zealand has won the toss and will bat first

aqeel: "Comments frequency has dropped as we close in on the contest? Come on everyone! I come here to read interesting comments." Post a good one yourself, then! :)

Adam S: "Nice to see Grandhomme taking over wicketkeeping duties from Latham. ;)" You chaps just don't miss anything, do you? That was up for the best part of 30 seconds, but hasn't stopped me hearing about it!

Haseeb: "@DR, NZ can be restricted under 250. Pakistani fans are not worrying about it"

Abuzar Amin: "The only thing Pakistan should think of now, early wickets , early wickets, early wickets .... "

Here are how the teams shape up

New Zealand: 1 Colin Munro 2 Martin Guptill 3 Kane Williamson (capt) 4 Ross Taylor 5 Tom Latham ((wk)) 6 Colin de Grandhomme 7 Jimmy Neesham 8 Mitchell Santner 9 Matt Henry10 Lockie Ferguson 11 Trent Boult

Pakistan: 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez 5 Haris Sohail 6 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt&(wk)), 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Mohammad Amir, 10 Wahab Riaz 11 Shaheen Afridi




Doesn't seem a good time to remind Pakistan fans only once this tournament has a total above 250 been chased, and that came in the game between West Indies and Bangladesh.




Sarfaraz says he wanted to bat first too. They aren't worrying about the conditions and wanted to set a target. "Good to see Amir back in form, as well as Wahab Riaz," he says. "The fielding is a concern but we're working hard and hopefully we'll do well as a fielding unit today."

Pakistan, too, are unchanged.




They are unchanged for the fifth game in a row. "You turn up and know you'll have a tough game, as Pakistan are a very tough side. For us, it's trying to build on those performances and keep improving," Williamson says. He says he expects the Kiwi fans to be vastly outweighed by Pakistan supporters, but he doesn't mind.




10:34am Toss at 11am. Start at 11.30am. No overs lost.


Sid Monga says New Zealand appear unchanged, though this isn't conformed yet, obviously. That, crucially, means Colin Munro and Matt Henry, the two who were most in danger of missing out, look set to play

sana: "my comment is not been posted even for a single time though I've been writing for ESPNcricinfo for almost 3 years. Bowling first in this situation is perfect thing to do after winning toss. But I dont think pakistan bowling is so up to the mark to bowl first and restrict NZ under 250"

Shernawaz: "With What margin should pakistan win to make its runrate into positive?" Too much. I'd say they aren't thinking along those lines. Besides, it doesn't matter. Pakistan and England will likely end up on a different number of points barring a tie or washout, while Pakistan and Bangladesh are unlikely to, given they still have to face each other.



.

Dhina: "Quick q. Why does it take so long between pitch inspection and toss? Couldn't the umpires simply signal for the captains to join them for the toss once they deem the conditions acceptable? Seems a bit of wasted time, no? " This is me having a punt, but I'd say once it's established the toss can go ahead, the preparation to clear the ground of everyone and everyone not directly to do with the game begins. It probably shouldn't take half an hour, but cricket doesn't like to be rushed.

Hello, everyone! So I'm here to take you through to the start of the game. At least this way, no one can accuse me of jinxing anything. Except, of course, if it begins to rain again, in which case I am patently guilty.

There's a pitch on the square that is wet. It has been covered with an astroturf-like carpet, says Monga from the ground.

Time to welcome Danyal Rasool into commentary. See you in a bit!


10:28am Two minutes to the inspection. The teams are warming up. Good signs.


What made Waqar Younis cringe when these two sides last met at the World Cup? Shashank tells us on the #LiveReport


ROBERT MILLER: "If the match is a washout will NZ have qualified for the semifinals?" --- Almost certainly, says Rajesh from the stats team. "SL could also get up to 12 with 5 wins, then they could be fighting for one spot. NZ have a good NRR, but if they lose two and SL win three, it could be different."

Saatybu: "This is probably New Zealand's last chance to experiment a bit with the lineup a bit. Despite the team winning - I'd still like to see Nicholls, Blundell and Southee come in for Munro, Latham and Henry respectively. They are quality players and deserve a spell."

AGNEL PEREIRA: "I never realised UK Weather forecasts are as sloppy as Bangalore's! And the guy who heads the Met here is one Mr S.Gavaskar (no relation to the super cricketer turned commentator, I presume)." --- No! Heads the Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, I think.


10:05 am Right, what is the most ideal scenario at the toss according to you? Shashank's got a poll running on the Live Report, so get in and vote!


Ahmed: "Hypothetically, if it is a washout today? what will be impact for pakistan chances? " --- Won't be as big an impact as if they lose. They can still get to 10 points with a washout today.

Rizwan: "How intresting, people are so enthusiastic about the 1992-2019 similarities, but do not want to bowl first, at any cost :) "

Julian McKinnon: "I remember '92 - it was when I first fell in love with cricket. That semi-final was devastating. I'd love to see NZ put that ghost to bed today."

Shamweel Qamar: "i am anxiously ready to leave my office here in South Korea for the match. Let's hope the players leave the boring dressing room to play on the field " --- Reckon you can get to Birmingham before the inspection?

Aftab: "I think Pakistan should never go for chase even though conditions are favoring 2nd batting. Once Newzealand puts a good total. They are gonna panick"

Dr iftikhar: "According to Ricky Ponting: Pakistan team can beat you the day they want to beat you. I hope its that day they are serious and not casual about fielding specially."

Shabaz: "Credit to SriLanka for their upset win over England because without that it would have been very straight forward. That victory brought the much needed spice to the tournament in regards with the semi's contention scenario."

Tabrez: "@Zeeshan check out the espncricinfo article on the similarities for Pak in 1992 and 2019. Its "MIND BOGGLING"" --- Yes. Here it is: The eerie similarities between 1992 and 2019 for Pakistan

James : "If the inspection gives the green light can we start in time to avoMohammad Haque: "I am just 2 miles from the ground. There was some drizzle this morning but is dry now and expected to be dry whole day.

Asif Khan: "I dont' get it, my weather app says 0% chance of rain all day?" --- Yours and many others! And lets hope it stays that way after this initial nuisance.

Salman: "in 1992 there was no rain in #PakvsNZ match. God save us from this dissimilarity :("


9:46am Right, there will be a delayed start. There will be an inspection at 10.30. Although the covers are coming off.


Sidharth Monga reports from the ground: "The mizzle is still in the air. You can see it on the glasses or if you leave your mobile outside. Not enough to stop play but not sure if you can start in it. There's hardly any breeze to blow it away."


9:37am It looks like we're going to have a battle with rain today. None at the moment, but there have been drizzles this morning. First battle is to start on time and it could go either way at the moment from what I hear.


ZEESHAN AHMED: "In 1992, New Zealand was the unbeaten side like this world cup until their group match with Pakistan who defeated them. Hoping for the trend to continue. Go Green Go"

Hasnain: "Come on Pakistan. Beat the logics. It's your time to prove the world wrong and somehow manage to reach last four!"

Tabrez: "I am worried about Sarfraz's tendeny to choose to bowl (if he wins the toos) by looking at the weather conditions, this will be half match lost if he does that. Learn from this tournament's history and make a wise decision to bat first"


9:32am Good morning! Welcome to today's coverage of the 1992 World Cup. New Zealand are on the brink of following Australia into the semi-finals, while Pakistan are far from any such comfort. Six points separating these two teams at the moment, a fair reflection of how different their campaigns have been so far.
