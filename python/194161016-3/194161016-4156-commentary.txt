Thomas to du Plessis, no run, another short ball, rears from the ground and du Plessis wants nothing to do with it again

Helgard Cronje: "It is not easy upfront. We need to learn to weather the storm first. Lets just get through the opening spell here. Faf and Quinten needs to take responsibility now..." At last a hopeful Saffer comment. But then again, with the Proteas, it's the hope that kills

ali: "Lets discuss about amla's technique. can anyone explain the dilemma of bat coming with an angle form 2nd slips?" Lots of you weighing in on Amla's plight with a lot of sympathy and kindness. Seems like everyone wants him to get out of this rut, but it just doesn't seem to happen

Cottrell to Markram, OUT, and Cottrell snares another one! Targeting Markram with the short ball, into his ribs. The batsman tamely flicks it, trying to run it down to fine leg. Gets a slight tickle on to it instead, which a diving keeper pouches. Markram barely even waits for the decision, walking off in disgust

Cottrell to Amla, OUT, this is too easy for West Indies! Amla got done by a bit of extra pace and bounce. Far too late rising with the ball to meet the bounce. It rushed the batsman, clipping him on the gloves and spooning to the slip fielder. Comfortable catch, and South Africa lose their first.

Roach to de Kock, no run, great delivery. Pitched on a length and moved away from the batsman, who, according to the umpire, edged it to the keeper, who takes an excellent one handed diving catch. de Kock has reviewed straightaway though, and it shows the ball came off his arm instead. Decision reversed.

Umar Gorsi: "Just a reminder, what happend when these two teams met last time in WC2015, Can we expect same sort of innings by any SA batsmen ?" A certain someone is missing, of course, even though he seems to be the only one we talk about. ANyway, here's Kemar Roach for his first ball of the World Cup

Right, the anthems are all done, and on a grey, grey day in Southampton, South Africa bat first in a game they must win, but it isn't just the West Indies they're up against. The forecast is, as you well know by now, less than ideal.

10:20am "The stumps are in, the hover-cover is off. This is very much ON (for the moment)," says Miller. Let us hope so. For the start of the innings, here is Danyal.

South Africa: 1 Quinton de Kock ((wk)), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Faf du Plessis (capt), 4 Aiden Markram, 5 Rassie van der Dussen, 6 David Miller, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Chris Morris, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Beuran Hendricks, 11 Imran Tahir

West Indies: 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Darren Bravo, 3 Shai Hope ((wk)), 4 Nicholas Pooran, 5 Shimron Hetmyer, 6 Jason Holder (capt), 7 Carlos Brathwaite, 8 Ashley Nurse, 9 Kemar Roach 10 Sheldon Cottrell, 11 Oshane Thomas

David De Villie: "That's a huge loss for WI, Russell would have been such a weapon in a shortened match like this!" --- It's not shortened yet!

Rabi: "Happy with the lineup from SA ! No russel for WI , ours to lose now!"

Shiny Side: "Keeping wickets in hand will be crucial today as the wickets column can have a big influence on DL adjustments."

Dillion Harper: "Looking forward to the game today! Made my way over here all the way from Jamaica, even better I'm here for work so am getting paid!" --- Livin' the dream!

Alex Steinberg: "Good toss for both teams. WI will want to continue their attacking momentum with the ball, SA should want to exorcise their batting demons head-on."

Faf: We were also looking to bowl first with the nature of the weather but we assume the whole day we'll be playing in overcast conditions. We've played two of the biggest teams England and India, but it's only week one. We're not focusing on the negatives. Aiden Markram and Beuran Hendricks are in.

Holder: Fielding because of the overhead conditions. We're expecting rain. The Australia loss hurt but no point dwelling on it. Two forced changes. Evin Lewis and Andre Russell are out. Bravo and Roach come in.

10:03am West Indies have won the toss and elected to bowl.

Liam's got a toss poll started on the Live Report. What would you do at the toss today? Head over and vote!

Miller's spotted Kemar Roach marking his run-up.

9:54am Not long for the toss now. And as you wait, you MUST read this from Sharda Ugra on how West Indies took just one match to make people forget they scrapped to qualification: Down Marshall Drive, a new West Indies promise to rekindle the old feeling

And here's more Miller, on fire and pace and other such exciting things: The allure of the Caribbean fire and Rabada factor

#Weather: "It's about as dry here as a soon-to-be-immersed swimming costume," says Miller from the ground. "But there is an apocalypse looming."

IQ: "Its a must win for SA. I say drop Duminy for Markram and lineup as Amla, De Kock, Rassie, Faf, Markram, Miller, Morris, Andile, Rabada, Tahir, Hendricks. That is all round balance. Good Luck Proteas!!!"

Muammar Khan: "Last roll of the dice surely for Proteas. Failure to win today, they might as well come home. Expecting an Amla special today."

Tim Coetzee: "South Africa need to play aiden markram tonight. Hes too good of a player to have in the sheds"

Sumit: "If WI wins today, there will not be anymore stopping for them untill Semis! And for sure that will be some show by them!"

Srini: "Good morning Varun. I expect Gabriel to replace Brathwaite today, and WI go for all out attack. Your views please? " --- I would do that too.<

Angelo Minnaar: "Hello here from South Africa. Let's hope today starts a new revival for South African cricket. Let's see and show the world that this is was we are made of. We have the team, now we just need to get the results."

Theo Vorster: "Good Morning from a chilly Pretoria, South Africa! Excited to see our team turn it around in this match!"

9:35am Hello! Welcome to Monday morning World Cup. That South African camp has probably had the equivalent of the Monday blues every day since their last match, what with the explosive news about AB de Villiers' change in mind that happened too late. Add those to the three losses they've had and the pretty much needing to win every match from here on, it's going to be a masive, massive game for them. And for captain Faf du Plessis, who has been the saviour so many times for so many teams. Can he overcome this challenge?

On the other side - West Indies. Who are being given more and more credit through their time in England than they've had for most of the last decade. If they haven't peaked, they're surely playing at close to this and in many ways, they've timed this ODI rebuild to perfection over the last two years. Came very close against Australia and had some of their own feisty moments but if there is one thing a Jason Holder team does well, it is move on to the next challenge. This should be exciting.

I am Varun and I will be joined by Danyal Rasool in commentary later. We'll bring you this game along with Liam Brickhill on the live blog, and Andrew Miller is with Sharda Ugra at the ground.
