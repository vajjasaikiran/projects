2.28pm Well hello again. Are you ready for the showdown? England's target is 286 - perhaps 40 runs fewer than Australia would have anticipated after 30 overs, and meat and drink for a side that has been putting 300 on the board for fun in this tournament ... until of course that nerve-shattering implosion against Sri Lanka last week ... is today redemption day, or the beginning of the end? If Australia can hold out, they will be through to the semi-finals. It's all to play for!


Match Coverage
##########
Michael Hussey, Graeme Swann and Murali Kartik give their thoughts on Australia's total on the live show. Andrew Miller will be back to start the chase in a little while.

Innings break 2.05pm Alex Carey's late flourish gives Australia something to bowl at. They made a mess of an outstanding start. Aaron Finch and David Warner were superb up front on a difficult pitch but neither could kick on to a big score. Finch got out for exactly 100. Warner made 53 and then the side fell away from there.

Aaron Finch: "It would have been nice to go on with it. It's never ideal to get a hundred and then get out. There's still enough in the wicket though. That's a pretty good score. It wasn't the easiest wicket to start on, the ball was seaming. We were conscious to try and get through that with as little damage as possible and we were able to do that. We got ourselves into a decent position. We could have got a few more runs."

Nisar: "Fine cameo from Alex Carey to avoid a complete shutdown towards the end there from Australia."

Yash: "Finch and Warner score at less than run a ball and couldn't capitalise after reaching the milestones. 9 think it worked in favour of England as the likes of Maxwell Stoinis and Carey didn't get enough time . But nonetheless a decent total. Should be an interest chase. "

John: "Never judge a pitch till both sides have batted on it! I thought the pitch against Sri Lanka was a good one that Sri Lanka had just wasted but it turned out it was tricky. England might make light work of 300 or get skittled. That's the beauty of cricket."

Abhijato: "England were supposed to be the best team in this World Cup, but their performances haven't shown that. Now, they unexpectedly find themselves under the pump. Their last three matches are virtual must-wins against the three best teams if they are to make it to the knockouts - an objective which the ECB has invested a lot in fulfilling (while also sacrificing their overall domestic structure's stability). The following three matches might just be the most important in their history..." They've not yet been at the races today, have they? At least, not since a few nibbled off the seam in the first over
