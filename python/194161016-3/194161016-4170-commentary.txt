Neesham to Brathwaite, OUT, has he done it? No! Boult plucks it at long-on! Two drops for Boult since the last game, but he's held on when it's mattered! They're checking for no-ball...it's well behind the line. This is heartbreak for Brathwaite. So close. Short ball at middle, he pulled it, but slightly from under again. Ended up slicing it, with no room. It was to Boult's right. He leaped, he held on, he balanced on his right foot. That is solid work under pressure. Both batsmen on their knees, and then Brathwaite gets up with a smile. He did his all, and then some. But it was always unlikely. And you feel like he knows that. Smiles from his opponents as they offer their commiserations. It's all shakes. It could have so easily been the other way round...

Neesham to Brathwaite, 2 runs, pulls out to deep midwicket and comes back for the second! What. An. Innings. He doesn't get to do a lot very often, down at No. 8. But every time he finds himself in this situation, he shines through. A maiden ODI hundred. An unlikely win in sight. Takes his helmet off, blows a kiss. Back to it.

Point, cover comes in, extra cover, mid-off in

Henry to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, top edge clears the wicketkeeper! Hear in the mouth, but he fortune is all his, it seems! Bouncer cramps him at the chest. He has no control over this shot. But it's trickled through to the third man boundary. 24 off the over!

What now for Brathwaite?
47.4
6
Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, it is too full! It is too far outside off! Knee high full toss with lots of width and he smokes it over wide long-off! Unreal. How does he keep finding himself in these situations, and doing this? Three in a row.

It's a packed off side field, it's going to full and outside off

Ohhh boy! Conference - four man conference. New Zealand are feeling this. Matt Henry is feeling this. He began this England tour conceding 107 in the first warm-up game. He's been here - West Indies taking him apart. It's happening again. Can he hold his nerve?

47.3

Henry to Brathwaite, SIX runs, and another! It is no longer a clear New Zealand advantage! Low full toss wide outside off. Reaches out and gets bat - just enough bat - to get it to land on the padding at deep backward point!

Boult to Thomas, no run, that's the end of Boult. Oshane has done it. He's played three balls from the best bowler on the day. What a spell from Boult, but he couldn't get this last inswinger past Oshane's push to mid-on

Cottrell to Williamson, no run, through him and West Indies are considering a review for caught behind. No wait, they are not. The umpires are going upstairs I think. Yes they are. Soft signal is out. Lovely ball, on leg stump and cutting in. Williamson was moving away, giving himself room, gets cramped and the ball goes between his bat and body, takes a feather. Hope dives to his left to take the ball. But replays show he grounded it while diving. Kane survives

Leighton: "It strikes me as odd that the KW last minute before the bowler comes in spins the bat. I get it is a habitual action - but one I thought he would have deleted in his constant pursuit of perfection. I will now go through the test to prove that unlike Kane - I am not a robot. "

Cottrell to Taylor, 3 runs, too full on the pads, and tucked away nicely by Taylor through midwicket. Big chase put in and they get three. What a first over.

Uh-oh, the game is six balls old, we've had an all-run four, both openers out for first-ballers, and a Kane W cover drive. Now Evin Lewis is limping off. Not sure what's wrong with him.

Priyank: "Well the only concern I am having at the moment is if Windies batsmen are going to face Boult with ball swinging under lights. The decision may just backfire but then they were not able to defend 321" - true enough. Might not have that many to chase given this start!

Cottrell to Munro, OUT, take a bow Sheldon Cottrell. take a salute. Inswinging yorker, late swing again and Colin Munro has no clue about it as it shatters his stumps. He's got both openers for golden ducks in his opening over.

Cottrell to Williamson, 3 runs, overpitched outside off, and a trademark Kane Williamson cover drive, all touch and elegance. No comical misfields that time, and Brathwaite got a hand to it diving to his left inside the circle to slow it up

Cottrell to Williamson, 4 runs, full toss second ball outside off, stroked easily through cover, and a bit of comical fielding by Brathwaite. He was running after the ball and dived too early with the ball still away from him! Ends up sprawled on the ground with the ball running away from him, until Shai Hope scrambles and picks it up. To no avail - they have run four!

Kane Williamson in, second ball of the match. Monga from Old Trafford: "DRS can't suppress the Cottrell salute. He waited out of the huddle as they watched the replay, and made sure he was in position to salute."

Cottrell to Guptill, OUT, starts off with a wonderful yorker first up and goes up in loud appeal. Shake of the head by the umpire and Jason Holder has gone up for a review. Ultra-Edge confirms no bat.Pitches on middle, swings in late, and it's taking out leg stump. What a start for West Indies! Wicket off the first ball, and it's Martin Guptill, the man who hit 237 against them in the 2015 World Cup quarterfinal
