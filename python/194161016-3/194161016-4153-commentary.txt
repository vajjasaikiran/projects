Archer to Mustafizur Rahman, OUT, fizzing bouncer, flicked to the keeper, and that's the end of that! That was a savage finale, speared right in at the tailender, who had nowhere to go, and a looping catch was gobbled by Bairstow.

Wood to Tamim Iqbal, OUT, gallops down the pitch, and holes out to extra cover! Tamim wasn't enjoying himsefl out there, and tried in vain to kick-start his innings with some pre-meditated aggression. It was not to be, a simple spooned catch, and Bangladesh are in some bother now

Wood to Shakib Al Hasan, no run, lining up the pull but that's too wide of off for a connection
Ajay Kumar Gour: "At the risk of being criticized and without having any doubt to Archer's talent, he's yet to be tested under pressure and by the hitters like Warner, Gayle, Dekock, Rohit etc who fancy pace in the bowling. Promising start but he's winning the tournament seems tad far fetched." Well ... it's a fair point. But he's looked the part alright. And easy pace, allied to reliable lines and lengths will trouble any new batsman.

All three had the intent to take the game to the opposition from the outset ...KP would have loved the "no consequences" attitude, Flintoff was lightning in his prime (gets in ahead of Wood), and imagine having Tres competing with Roy and Bairstow at the top of the order ...

A record that is likely to be set right in this World Cup given the form the England openers have been in."

Ebrahim: "Based on week 1, I can say that the biggest challenge for any team will be facing the Windies attack with the new ball, barring Windies themselves obviously. A Jos Buttler after the 35th over or a determined Rohit Sharma would fight for second place. Think facing Riaz and the rest of Pakistan at the death falls third." Fair assessment. And Bumrah with the new ball looks pretty lethal too!

I know they are a cricket frenzy nation who set their own terms/conditions, but a WC comes once in 4 years: rules must be same for all! #INDvSA. Why SA played 3 games in same time.... is something unusual and impartial. " It is strange, isn't it? I mean, India playing late is one thing. But not sure why their first game couldn't have been someone else's second.

Of course, had South Africa not muffed their lines in this tournament, it could have been a massive advantage to them ... confidence and form etc... but it, err ... wasn't.
