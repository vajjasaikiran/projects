Sree: "Duminy reminds me of robin singh. Will keep your hopes alive when all seems lost, but gets out around the 47th over to end hopes. Have seen this earlier in the 90s too, seeing it again." -- Reminded of that India-Australia WC game in 1999 as you say that. His partnership with Jadeja kept India alive, raised a few hopes until they were all dashed

Mohammad Saifuddin to Rabada, 1 run, sliced into the off side, cover and point thought the other would go for it. No one did in the end. Mehidy and Shakib the two men

Venkat : "The major reason I believe SA have let this game away from their grasp was their decision to chase at the toss. Failed in the first game with the bat and still unable to fathom that chasing big totals in a world cup is a different ball game altogether. Worst part is most players in the squad have vast experience playing in English conditions."

Mustafizur Rahman to Imran Tahir, 2 runs, steered into the gap at square third man for a couple

Bas: "AB was (and still is) a brilliant cricketer, perhaps the best in his time. But he's done, so why is everyone still talking about him? I love AB, but come on my Proteas fellows, move on - he is not the "chosen one" (there's no such thing)."

Mustafizur Rahman to Imran Tahir, no run, swing and a miss. Good ball, went full and across

Ram_Modies hits the nail on its head: "This will come down to south africa's basic errors in the field - in the last 4 overs they had fielders about 10 metres in trying to save the extra run and giving some 30 runs in excess of what they ended up conceding. Just arrogant cricket over sensible damage control processes. "

Imran Tahir has to hit them out of the park at the pace he runs around after picking a wicket. Can he?
47.1
W
Mustafizur Rahman to Duminy, OUT, dragged on! This is a slower bouncer, JP backs away and looks to pull, through with the stroke early as this goes back onto the stumps right off the toe-end. Surely it's all over for South Africa now? What a performance from The Fizz.

JP Duminy b Mustafizur Rahman 45 (62m 37b 4x4 0x6) SR: 121.62

Right. Down to the last five. South Africa need 63 off five. In T20 cricket, this is very much in the realms of possibility. Mustafizur will bowl three of those in all probability. It's now or never. Duminy the key. Can he pick this over for 18-20?

Cuts back in from outside off on a length, JP is hurried into a defensive stroke which he tries to execute from the crease, but it's the fizz (no pun intended) that does him in. Hit high on the pad but mind you he was rooted to the crease and the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Clear gap between bat and pad, only thing to see was if it would've hit the stumps. Ball tracking says no so the original decision has been reversed. Huge relief for South Africa

Mehidy Hasan Miraz to de Kock, OUT, dropped but Mushfiqur makes amends But guess what? De Kock has been run out. Bangladeshi fans go from agony to ecstasy in a matter of two milliseconds. De Kock looks to cut, but gets a thin edge that is put down. Clearly nervous, he takes off for a run but is left high and dry as Markram doesn't move. Mushfiqur has the presence of mind to run quickly to his right, pick up the ball and hit the stumps at the striker's end to catch him well short. Brain fade from de Kock.

10.22am The teams are out on the ground for the anthems.

News from the South African camp regarding Hashim Amla's health. Proteas team manager, Dr Mohammed Moosajee explained: "Hashim hasn't fully recovered from the blow sustained to the helmet during the match against England on Thursday and is not available for selection for the match today. With the quick turnaround between the two matches, he is being rested as a precaution, based on our post-match re-assessment. We are hopeful that he will make a full recovery to be available for selection for our next match against India."

10.15am The pitch is the same one that was used in the England South Africa tournament opener. Pace and bounce is expected but there should be runs on offer.

nafiz: "SA to bowl first. By using extra pace Du plessis means a bouncer barrage. Lets see what our top 3 is made of"

Takks Mota Musi: "Bating top Shakib Vs Tahir.. where Tahir has dismissed Shakib three times in less than 10 overs. "

Karthik: "Both teams have same green colour Jersey is there any changes in Jersey colour for today . Heard every team is having two different coloured Jersey, is that so" South Africa will wear their yellow top with green pants.

10.00am Toss: South Africa have won the toss and will bowl first .
