Thanks Alex. Well, though it's rather too late to make a real difference, South Africa appear to have hit their straps. They're in sight of a pride-salvaging win.

Nilashish: "Still remember being a 9 year old kid in 1996, watching my first world cup on TV, a small black and white Bush, mesmerized by the slaughter of UAE by Kirsten, but more so by Andrew Hudson against Netherlands. Was so impressed by Hudson, I coaxed my uncle to take me to the test match at Eden later that year, again, Hudson didn't disappoint me, but I saw my Hero's debut there, a guy called Lance klusener..

Amla is walking off already. Ball tracking says it pitched outside leg! That was always the query. It will be reversed. Amla has to walk back. Faf was correct. It pitched just outside leg. Only fractionally. It did look in doubt live but Amla thought it was out.

Dilshan and Herath followed, Malinga soon too. SLC needs to learn from the last four years, pick a group of 18-20 players, and regardless of the results, critics and backlash, stick with those players for an extended period of time.

Malinga to de Kock, no run, de Kock stands up tall to pull a short one well in front of square on this slow track, but his shot finds a tumbling midwicket fielder and is stopped

de Silva to de Kock, FOUR runs, how has he cut this? There's virtually no width to work with, so de Kock makes his own, chopping a cut off the stumps and very fine down to third man
3.4
0
de Silva to de Kock, no run, here's the danger that the offspinner brings! Dhananjaya pulls his length back a shade, and instead of turning this one rushes on with the arm to take the inside half of de Kock's defensive press
Rahul: "SL can mathematically go in, even if they lose today! " -- Yes, but those are some very complex mathematical equations to get them there!

Malinga to Amla, FOUR runs, but it's no use if you bowl there. Having just moved a fielder out of the midwicket position, Malinga dishes up a leg-stump half volley that Amla gleefully thumps through the empty leg side field for four

Malinga to Amla, no run, in the channel outside off, and Amla lets this one go
Sarah: "SL need to win this to stay in contention yes? I don't particularly want to see SA lose but i want SL to keep things spicy in the lead up to the semis " -- Yes indeed. Meanwhile, on the field, an extra slip comes in

2.1

Malinga to de Kock, FOUR runs, punched down the ground, straight as an arrow. This was too full from Malinga, and too straight. But de Kock still had some work to do timing his shot on this track, and does so perfectly
Just the one slip in place now, with a catching fielder at a short, straight mid on

Dhananjaya de Silva's offspin is immediately called upon for de Kock. Almost a quarter of his dismissals in ODIs have come to offspin, and he averages only around 38 against this type of bowling. There's a slip in place

0.5

Malinga to Amla, FOUR runs, four more! And a bit more oomph in this one as Malinga strays in to Amla's pads and is dismissively flicked to the midwicket boundary. Grace on the off side, power to leg

Malinga to Amla, FOUR runs, timing and grace from Amla, who is off the mark with a picturesque cover drive that sends the ball bouncing through the covers. It keeps the fielders interested, but there's enough on it to take it all the way

Malinga to Amla, no run, gentle shape away from the bat again, but Amla lets this one go past him and just has a look. Not a great deal of lift out of the track, and it dies on the way through to the keeper

Malinga to de Kock, 1 run, there's some shape straight away from Malinga, in to the left hander, but it starts wide and so is easily dabbed down to third man for a single
2.43pm Umpires Ravi and Tucker take the field, and behind them come the Sri Lankans, who quickly form a huddle on the outfield. Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock are the last to take the field, and we're moments from the start of the chase. Lasith Malinga will bowl the first ball. De Kock will face it. Two slips behind him.

The Sri Lankan openers are headed out. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera. Dimuth is on strike first up. Kagiso Rabada has the new ball. 10.25am The players are out there for the anthems. While we wait for the start, read this masterpiece from Andrew Fidel Fernando on the fire-breathing Lasith Malinga.

Teams batting second have won 11 of the 16 ODIs at Durham. But it might not be a bad toss to lose.

Wajid Jawaid: "Dear South Africa, Pakistan is with you today. If that sounds surprising, Pakistan will be cheering for India tomorrow!! #justworldcupthings" What a world.

Karunasoma: "Surprised with the decision to rest NGIDI who was bowled very good against SL " He's had a poor World Cup. Hasn't taken a wicket in the first 10 overs of any match and has conceded 7.2 rpo in the first powerplay and a boundary every 4.7 balls. They need more upfront.

10.00am Faf calls tails, it is a tail, and South Africa will bowl.

"It's a fresh pitch, so we'll be looking to use the seam movement early today," says Faf du Plessis.

Two changes for South Africa, with Dwaine Pretorius coming in for Lungi Ngidi, and JP Duminy slotting in for David Miller, who has tweaked his groin. Faf didn't say so at the toss, but I suspect South Africa have decided not to play Ngidi given his earlier injury troubles in the tournament. No point risking him at this stage.

"Win," is Faf's succinct response to what South Africa are hoping to get out of this game. "We're playing an extra batter today, hopefully that will free up the batters. We deserve everything that's come towards us," he says of criticism of the team, "but it's important to put that to one side and try to be the best cricketer you can be."

"It seems like a good wicket, and if we can put a score on the board the bowlers can do the rest," adds Dimuth Karunaratne. "We want the experienced guys to stand up and take responsibility. We just want to win this match and go forward."

Sri Lanka have also made a change to their XI - Nuwan Pradeep has chicken pox, apparently, and he's been replaced by Suranga Lakmal.

Here are the playing XIs:

South Africa: 1 Quinton de Kock ((wk)), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Aiden Markram, 4 Faf du Plessis (capt), 5 Rassie van der Dussen, 6 JP Duminy, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Dwaine Pretorius, 9 Chris Morris, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Imran Tahir

Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), 2 Kusal Perera ((wk)), 3 Avishka Fernando, 4 Kusal Mendis, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Jeevan Mendis, 7 Dhananjaya de Silva, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Isuru Udana, 10 Lasith Malinga, 11 Suranga Lakmal

muddassir khan: "i s there any forecast about rain?" -- Nope, the weather should be set fair today.

shihan: "chicken pox is the last thing Pradeep can expected in his injury hit career..sigh "

BS: "Chicken pox!!!. This is the time to ask I think. How many other players in the team have already had it." -- All of them, hopefully. And if not, he's surely been quarantined.


Mark: "Hi Liam, great to see lovely CLS get such an important game. Surely, today will be the day that South Africa re-awaken? They have been far below their best but will look at this fixture and know that they *should* win (just how much in disarray they are we will find out soon) to at least go home with a couple of wins under their belt." -- It's (almost) now or never, Mark. There will, at least, be no pressure to perform. Although it would be a little frustrating for the fans if South Africa come out and cruise through their last two games.

Pushkar: "it will bring more spice to the tournament if SL win the game with a good margin!! go malinga go!!"

Vinod Rajpal: "Hey Liam, Good Morning : Dead Rubber for S.Africa & a knock-out for the Lankans !! Should be a great contest..."

Nibraz Ramzan: "Nuwan Pradeep to miss today's game due to a sudden illness, Srilanka might play Suranga Lakmal and that will be the only change i expect from Srilanka's XI." -- I think you might be right.

Rana Sarmad: "As a Pakistan Team fan I want South Africa to win this."

Justin: "Thought I'd get my views in early: As a Saffa, this has obviously been yet another disappointing WC campaign. On the bright side though, at least the Proteas have spared me the agony of getting close before failing! Hoping they finish strong - it can't be fun for the players either."

9.30am Good morning everyone, and a warm welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of Sri Lanka's match against South Africa at Chester-le-Street. I'm Liam Brickhill, and alongside me today will be Alex Malcolm, while Dan Brettig will be joining us on the Live Report.
