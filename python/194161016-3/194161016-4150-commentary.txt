Vaibhav Lall: "Should India have accelerated a few overs earlier, keeping in my how net run rate can be a critical factor in the long run in this tournament." -- If you keep stringing wins, net-run-rate won't matter. In a long tournament of nine league games, you really can't play for NRR from the first game. And it wasn't like India was facing a mediocre attack. Steyn or no-Steyn, this is still a competent attack.

Pandya is the new man. Not Jadhav. Rohit crossed over and is on strike

Morris to Dhoni, OUT, high, very very high. Morris calls for it and as it descends, he's so into the catch that he falls over onto the stumps at the non-striker's end even as the ball lodges in his bucket hands. Called very early and completed it.

Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run, reaches out and squeezes this over point. Saw Dhoni stepping out and bowled it wide.

sravan's theory of reverse cup: "The reverse cup is a confusing unnatural mechanism. Although it is considered a more secure way of catching, I've never understood why. The ball tends to roll down or pop out along the inner side of the cup more often than not. Having your body behind the cup would act as a natural protection. The reverse cup, as was just witnessed, just comes in the way of the catch."

Phehlukwayo to Sharma, no run, huge appeal, a massive plea. Was this missing? Faf and his team converge. They review. My impression: going down leg. This one skidded on much faster than Rohit anticipated, was looking to work this to across the line, hit on the flap of the pad. No bat, height and line in question possibly. Ball tracking comes on and it says this would've clipped outside of leg. So the onfield decision stays. NOT OUT.

Chahal to Phehlukwayo, OUT, it's the guile of Chahal that has him a fourth! Steps out to hoick with the spin but didn't get to the pitch, the ball breaks back in to beat the swing, the inside edge as MS Dhoni effects a stumping after a brief stumble. He was blinded by the swing initially and that may have thrown him off gear. The ball bobbled but he had so much time to regain his composure because Andile was so far down the pitch.

Ganesh: "When I started watching cricket, India was always a batting heavy team (Just like RCB with occasional bowling surprises) it was only the batters that won the games. Such a delightful watch to see the bowling unit in recent years. Especially BUMRAH. He is that one dream Indian cricketer that kids of 90s where always longing for. A fast bowler from India that sends chill down opposition's spine. If India to win this world cup it's our bowling unit that has to contribute highly. "

Kapil Baldawa: "SA lost the plot between overs 12 and 19 when they allowed someone like Hardik to get away and that was their best chance to apply any pressure on India. Faf and Dussen hardly looked to get out of jail and now looking too ordinary against spinners. Rassie should have gone after Hardik and given Kohli something to think about. SA for me would be out of SF race due to sheer pressure of winning 5 out of 6 if the lose this one"

It looks adjacent, it's given out, but Duminy reviews it. Needlessly so, it turns out, as three reds come back and he's got to go. It was a little desperate, but given the game situation, Duminy had to ask for another look. South Africa sink ever further

Enter JP Duminy. Like Miller, he could really do with some runs. He only has three fifties in the 31 innings he has played in the last three years at an average of 30 and SR of 86.5. A lot of Duminy's troubles are a result of his inability to neither score at a good rate in the middle overs not avoid getting out. 19 of his 24 dismissals in this period have come in the 11-40 over phase and for an SR of 73.75. In the middle, it's spin from both ends

Chahal to van der Dussen, OUT, GOT HIM! That is not pretty. Not pretty at all. Legspinners can do this to batsmen: make them look foolish. And that's what happens when Rassie telegraphs his intentions to reverse sweep, getting into position very early. But the drift takes the ball towards leg stump, and the rip sends it clattering into the timber. He's already planted his front foot, and can't reach around at the ball. Bowled around his legs!

Thanks Debayan. Well, I don't know about you, but I've been taken quite by surprise by the character of today's pitch. This is, after all, the same ground where a whopping 734 runs were scored just over three weeks ago in the match between England and Pakistan.

Which is not to say India's bowlers shouldn't take much of the credit - they should, but they've undoubtedly been helped by some variable (and sometimes alarming) bounce in the track. It's spinning, too.

Abhijit: "So far, van der Dussen has looked more comfortable than du Plessis. The former seems to be calm, while the latter is trying too many things! " -- Faf has been a little hither and thither, hasn't he?

Graham : "With the intensity and passion that these bowlers are playing with so far, it may be a case of who has the most fit bowlers at the pointy end of the tournament " Yep, it's a long road. I suspect we'll see some rotation along the way

Sanjay: "Got to feel for South Africa and captain Faf. ABD retiring just an year before the WC, first choice bowlers in Nortje, Steyn and Ngidi missing out due to injuries and running into England and India in the space of 7 days and all people belittling them. Just imagine if this happened to Indian cricket with Virat retiring, and Bumrah, Shami and Bhuvi missing out due to injuries. "

Bumrah to de Kock, OUT, Bumrah has TWO! He's bowled better balls than this one, to be honest. Throws it a bit wide, but still fuller than most, and de Kock has a swish at it, and the outside edge carries it through to Kohli at third slip. That's one major blow for South African hopes

Shiva on the Bhuvi selection: "Interesting choice not to play Mohammed Shami today. He would've been a handful for South Africa's top order: South Africa's top three against Shami in ODI - 4 dismissals, average of 17.25. Bhuvneshwar Kumar averages 163 against them with 1 dismissal. The Indian think-tank must have felt that Bhuvneshwar is better equipped to exploit the early swinging conditions."
