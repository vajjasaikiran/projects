Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, OUT, short, and slapped straight to Richardson on the fence! That's a body blow! Babar's drives alone were going to win this game at a canter. But he's lured into a response to the bouncer, and doesn't come close to getting his wrists over the ball. Dragged down from way over his head like an amateur fly-fisherman, and backward square is in business again

Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 no ball, tight line and length, on the back foot, but an over-step! It's a free hit coming up! In fact, it shouldn't have been called, but too late now...

2.32pm Here come the players. Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq to lead the line in what is ostensibly a daunting target, but is little more than a run-a-ball ... and in this day and age, it's not out of the question, especially for a side that was scoring 340-plus for fun against England recently... (okay, and losing...)

2.27pm Hello again... well, we've got a contest here, in spite of everything. When Aaron Finch and David Warner were in harness, there were visions of 400 flitting through the Australian dressing-room. Instead they've scraped past 300 after a stunning spell from Mohammad Amir. But anything he can do, Mitchell Starc can surely match it ... don't stray far! The chase will be underway any minute now ...

Mike Hussey, our Match Day studio analyst, reckons Warner's innings was liking watching the batsman of old ...

Rahul Pagaria: "For almost two decades, the cricketing world has been praising the fighting spirits of other teams or players against Australia, while Australia winning with comfortable margins. I reckon today will be the same day with all praises for Amir, but still, Aussies winning in the end."

Nitish R: "I like the idea of having Shaheen and Amir open the bowling especially against Finch. He averages just 13.9 vs left arm pace. Warner is a different story; his lower SR in this WC is perhaps due to bowlers(right arm) ensuring they dont give him a lot of room by bowling tighter lines while running in over the wicket. Remains to be seen if Hasan Ali follows a similar approach. "

Australia's openers are out there. Aaron Finch will take strike with Warner at the other end. Amir has the new ball.

Sid Monga: This is the ground where Mohammad Amir played his first first-class match on comeback. And he played a big part in bowling Somerset out for 128, and none other than Marcus Trescothick praised him for swinging the ball, and swinging it late. Pakistan will want much of that in a few minutes' time.

Both teams are out there for the anthems.

Baskar: "Finally, we might see Smith rolling his arm today after a long time. Interestingly today, both the teams depend on an all-rounder who rarely complete their bowling quota." Will be interesting. He did a bit of bowling in the warm-up games. He didn't bowl a lot when he was captain.

Marshall Raja: "Aus and swinging ball. There could be only one winner. Why do they always get to bat in overcast conditions."

Rajesh Banda: "@Alex - you forgot to greet viewers from Asian coutries and it is afternoon here in India.. :P " I did. Apologies. Good afternoon to you all!

10.20am So, ten minutes to go until the first ball. I reckon it could be a lively first hour. Here's Alex Malcolm to tell you all about it...

Thanks Andrew. Morning all. Or evening, if you're in Australia or New Zealand. Big test for Australia against the new ball. Mohammad Amir has been very good in the first Powerplay in this World Cup so far.

Meanwhile, the NBA Finals are tantalisingly poised with Toronto Raptors leading the Golden State Warriors 3-2 going into Thursday's match. Who holds the edge, and what is the latest on Kevin Durant's injury? Find out here

10.14am Yasir Lodhi: "I don't think sitting Shadab out is a wise decision even with Green Top pitch. Shadab has been their striking bowler in middle overs whereas Shaheen Afridi has struggled big time even against weaker opposition like Afghanistan." It's curious isn't it, especially given Taunton's nickname is "Ciderabad", given how spin-friendly Somerset's wickets tend to be ...

Osman Samiuddin has been off his long run on the #LiveReport in response to Shadab's omission ... get it while it's hot!

sanjeev kakarap: "You never know who is going to be the impact player from the opposition when you play against Pakistan or Australia. Lets wait and see? Hopefully the skies will be clear in the Taunton today"

10.07am Adnan Ali: "History will tell you Australia will win this match.. but watching last match of Pakistan against England, and then analysing score card of Pakistan batting in last two series make it in doubt that Australia will be favorites.. this will be a tight match.." Damn right. It's rarely less than fascinating when these two meet!

Pakistan will be wearing black armbands in memory of two fellow countrymen, the former player, Akhtar Sarfraz, who died at the age of 43 this week, and the former Test umpire Riazuddin, who stood in 12 Tests between 1990 and 2002.

Pakistan win the toss and bowl first! "A bit of grass, looks like a green pitch, a bit of moisture," says Sarfraz. "Unfortunately we didn't play the last game, but worked hard with lots of practice."

Aaron Finch says he would have bowled first too... "One-off games in different conditions, you expect to come up against the best. It'll have to be wait-and-see what the wicket does first-up." Richardson, with his death bowling, gets in ahead of Jason Behrendorff as Zampa sits out, as does Nathan Lyon.

Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch (capt), 3 Usman Khawaja, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Shaun Marsh, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Alex Carey ((wk)), 8 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 9 Pat Cummins, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 Kane Richardson

And no Shadab for Pakistan, Shaheen Afridi comes in. Interestingly. It's seam or bust for both sides today!

Pakistan 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt & (wk)), 6 Shoaib Malik, 7 Asif Ali, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Hasan Ali, 10 Shaheen Afridi, 11 Mohammad Amir

10am Right, let's have a toss, shall we?

9.57am Murthy: "From India, I would love to see if Wahab Riaz gets his best figures today. He bowled his heart out in 2019 match....." Indeed ... that was fun! Shane Watson was all but decapitated ... but lived to fight another day!

9.55am Right, five minutes to the toss, which means you've got a split-second to adjust your Cricket Picks for today's game. After all, it is Pakistan. Which side of bed have they got out of? I'm sensing something today ... that's all I'm saying ...

Yash: "OK all set. Got my coffee, muffins almost done in the oven, got my books because exam next week (don't do medicine kids), TV is on, laptop set, cricinfo on the phone. If it rains, I will burn everything to the ground. "

9.48am Right, ten minutes until the toss. So let's get stuck into some required reading for today's game. Monga is concerned about David Warner's rather defensive mindset after a rather stately start to his World Cup. While Osman is riffing on Fakhar, Imam and Babar at the top of the order, Pakistan's heartbeat

Afnan Ahmed: "Thank you CricInfo. Been on a plane from Oslo to Singapore and straight into all day meetings. Now instead of going to sleep, I look forward to you in bringing all of us a great match :) "

9.41am Ammar Ahmed: "Andrew, how many more losses can realistically knock SA chances of qualifying for the semis?" None... they are in last-chance saloon already. Five wins in a row is surely the minimum.

Suryansh : "Ok guys, help me with one thing. What happens if wc semi-final are abandoned due to rains (including reserve days)? And the same happens for finals? Another hypothetical scenario - starting today if all games are abandoned because of rain, who will win the world cup? NZ?" Well seeing as it's in England at the moment, I guess we keep it.

9.34am Anns Mahboob: "If Andrew's commentary today is remotely similar to his live report the other day from the rain affected match, we are all in for a great treat!" Why thank you, but I rather hope it isn't... much as I love commentating on cloud formations, I secretly quite like actual cricket too!

dez: "Here's your cut & paste for the first ball (delete names as appropriate) - Amir/Starc steams in, good length ball just outside off stump. Jags back in a long way, through the gate & Finch/Imam's leg stump is floored. What a start!!" It's on my clipboard, just in case ...

Ali Kehar: "If Pakistan play four quicks, they will have to put shadab out which i think would be a very bad decision. Even if they leave the extra batsmen out, shadab will come in at 7 which makes the batting that much weaker and unbalanced." The poor lamb may not be able to feel his fingers today, which may be a factor ...

Yoel: "Say it out, Say it loud Cricket is on today, Give or take a cloud"

9.30am Looking like four quicks for Pakistan, says Osman Samiuddin, our other lurker on the boundary's edge. He's straining his eyes to see which of the pace options is sulking and kicking cones around the outfield.

Hamza: "Ohh come on please tell me if I'm right already? The weather forecasts for Taunton today says that the weather is pretty cloudy for the entire day, but no rain, am I right? " You might be right... but you might not be! It's the English summer, anything could happen!

John: "All the initial messages suggest that we could atleast get some Cricket back again today! Hurray!" I strongly believe this to be the case, yes ...

9.29am Warner's going slow, Zampa's bowling half-trackers, the batsmen bar Smith aren't having a great time of it yet, but Australia have Mitchell Starc and World Cup aura. How far can those two take them? 'It's just two knockout games, and weird things happen', says Jarrod Kimber on our latest Talking World Cup episode (you can subscribe on Apple Podcasts here, if that's your thing)

9.23am "Both teams are warming up," says Monga, through swift chugs of Old Monk. "Lots of beanies around. The pitch has been under covers for two days. Definitely a bowl-first day. Pitch looks green. Langer and Arthur have hugged. Warner is chatting with Clarke and Vaughan. Starc and Richardson have marked their runs. Afridi has too. Hasan too. It's cold but it's all happening."

I couldn't have put it better myself, so I won't. But the fact that Richardson is pacing his run out adds weight to the rumour of two changes to Australia's team. Stoinis and Zampa out, Shaun Marsh and Richardson in. Sit tight, and all shall be revealed!

Khurram: "Good morning to all, here is the Weather report for today's match: 11°C, Wind NE at 16 km/h, 92% Humidity. Its cloudy here in Taunton but very less chance of rain & more chance of game, don't forget its England weather which is one minute down, next minute up. " My work here is done. Cut and paste is the future of live comms!

9.15am Good morning all, and welcome to the latest installment of the Great South Western Rain Dodge... yes, after consecutive wash-outs in Bristol, we've gone bombing down the M5 to Taunton today, for Pakistan against Australia, one of the more storied rivalries in World Cup history. ... not least on English soil. Will today be a repeat of this epic encounter ... or this less-than-epic finale? Or just a repeat of this less-than-fully-formed last outing for Pakistan at the current World Cup...?

Well, without further ado, let's cross to our huddled masses in the Taunton press-box ... Sidharth Monga is lurking at this match for us, and he enthusiastically informs us: "It looks fairly miserable. But dry." Hurrah!
