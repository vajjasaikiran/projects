Gabriel to Liton Das, FOUR runs, fittingly this match ends with a short ball that's pulled to the boundary. Moved inside the line again and pulled it well to the left of the fine leg fielder, who could be forgiven for not really exerting himself while running after it as it bounces over the ropes. Bangladesh have just demolished West Indies in stunning fashion. Highest successful chase in Bangladesh's ODI history, and highest in this World Cup.

Rishiraj Kamath: "This chase reminds me of India's chase against Sri Lanka in the 2012 CB series where they hit 320 odd in 38 overs. Windies' WC campaign is down the WC." - incidentally that was also driven by their No.3. One Mr Virat Kohli, who played the first of his ODI masterpieces

Holder to Liton Das, no run, short ball that pops up towards square leg off a mistimed pull. Russell is there but he does what can only be described as a hobble-run towards the ball. I don't know how his joints are working to put one leg in front of the other, frankly.

Shahir : "Can't help but feel west indies have been a bit unimaginative as well, not that there's much room for it with the hostile, all out pace attack, but definitely this is where a bowler like Amir comes in with his smarts & game awareness and comes up with a new plan quick!

Malcolm: "@John Iain I think that game against Australia really messed with the Windies self belief. They had Australia absolutely on the ropes there and then blew it with some really rash shots. They're a really talented side but sorely lacking in direction and control. They could learn a lot from the very side they're playing right now"

Pressan Pandara: "Shakib is in amazing form but to suggest he's only become consistent now is untrue. Form and consistency are different things. You don't average almost 40 and not be fairly consistent. "

Russell to Soumya Sarkar, OUT, he's guided this to Gayle at slip! Good bowling by Russell but a bit of a gift with a loose shot. Dug this in short outside off and it came back into Soumya, cramping him for room. He's been playing the dab nicely but didn't have the width to do that. Didn't have the width to ramp it up and over either, and he ended up doing something in between, only guiding it to Gayle at slip.

Salman: "You say WI have a depleted bowling attack ... but Gayle and Russell both have averages below 35 and economy rates under 6 in ODI ... with those two as part time and other 4 front line fast bowlers I think it is still a very decent attack" - fair point. I'm just a bit skeptical about Russell lasting 5-6 overs. Here's Holder.

Readers in India, watch Hetmyer hit his way to the joint-fastest fifty this World Cup, on Hotstar. Also, from Hotstar here's highlights of Lewis' half-century.

Jez: "I'm wondering whether most of the captains at this WC are misreading the English pitches. How many games have been: win the toss, bowl first, concede 300+, lose. " - well there's still this chase to come, let's see how it pans out. Remember West Indies are short on bowling, having swapped out Carlos Brathwaite for Darren Bravo.

Geoff Edwards: "Talk all you want about small boundaries, but 105m is a six at any ground!" - and it should be, like 12, at some grounds!

Also, while Gayle didn't hit any sixes today, he has hit quite a few for Somerset. And there's an endearing story to one of those hits too...

2.40pm: There were big sixes hit today - but they came off Nicholas Pooran, Shimron Hetmyer and Jason Holder. Hetmyer hit one 104 metres, a tournament high. A few overs later, Holder smashed it 105 metres.

Meanwhile, for all the talk about sixes by Gayle and Russell on a small ground...

2.33pm: Thanks Debayan. Think Bangladesh's opening combination holds the key. A good start, and they'll be up and away. If the West Indies' quicks can inflict early damage though, then it's a whole other game - small ground or not.

2.26pm Right, an exciting chase coming up, and Saurabh will pick up the reins of that in a short while. While you wait for the chase to begin, here's an interesting long read on an inspirational rugby story that will soon come alive on the silver screen. When you get done with that, take this quiz I put together on the fathers of cricket. Make sure you share your scores on Twitter and over here. Ciao!

Shai Hope tells Simon Doull: "It was a bit slow, but enjoyed batting there. We've got some good power in the bowling, and we've got to capitalise on the new ball and pick some wickets. Shimron and Jason batted well to give us some impetus, especially at that stage."

2.20pm This match is quite interestingly poised at the half-way stage. You'd have to say West Indies have done the hard yards by posting 321 on the board. But this looks like a decent batting wicket, the ground is a small one, and West Indies could be a bowler short today, since they omitted Carlos Brathwaite to accommodate Darren Bravo. The innings ebbed and flowed, but it was really the innings of Shai Hope which gave them the glue to work around

Shakib Al Hasan to Hetmyer, no run, starts with a full ball, down the leg side, and Hetmyer has an almighty heave across the line. Seems to have come off his pad and landed on the leg side

In walks Hetmyer. ESPNcricinfo Forecaster says West Indies should get up to 293 from here. Will that be enough?

Thanks, Saurabh. Meanwhile, the Copa America has gotten underway this weekend, and Argentina fell to a 2-0 defeat to Colombia. Is this a classic case of overdependence on a star player?

With West Indies set for a late charge (or a late collapse), handing it back to Debayan.

Shakib Al Hasan to Pooran, OUT, and he's picked out long-on. West Indies need to get a move on, and Pooran was striking them well, but he didn't connect cleanly here. Went down on one knee to slog-sweep but got it off the toe end. Swirled high, more height than distance and settled into long-on's hands

Stat from Shiva: Shai Hope has been the slowest of batsmen in this World Cup: among 31 batsmen to score at least 100 runs, his strike rate has been the lowest at just over 61 runs per balls - a rate that was barely acceptable in the pre-T20 era. The problem? Strike rotation, or the lack of it. Hope's dot-ball percentage at 60 is among the worst in this tournament. And it's not as if Hope is better at turning the strike over when he's settled in: until the 25th over of West Indies' innings in this match, the following was his dot percentage split over his innings across matches in the World Cup. It is the least when he's faced over 60 balls, and still at an unhealthy 47%.

Waqas: "Who is the fifth bowler for West-indies? Russ, Is he fit enough to bowl 10 overs?" - well they did turn to one Christopher Henry Gayle in their last ODI. Maybe more overs for him. Which of course means more entertainment for us.

Sajib: "Of course the captains would have assessed the pitch better, but with too much dependence on spin, Bangladesh could better go back to their winning formula - put a score and then choke WI batsmen to death."

Sadmim Rahman: "With 5 of the top 6 being left handers in the Windies batting line up Mehedy will be very crucial. Good decision by the management to stick with him and resist the temptation to bring in Rubel. However the short boundaries and the mighty Power hitters will a challenge for the spinners today "

Anns Mahboob: "Trust me this match is going to be far more exciting than yesterdays 'big show' event. These two teams are far more evenly matched than Pakistan and India are currently. Hoping for a cracker."

Harsha: "No 140k+ bowlers to trouble Gayle, how will BD nullify his threat? Could we see Mehedi with the new ball? " - we could indeed. Mohammad Isam has analysed in some depth what Mehidy Hasan brings to the team and his success against West Indies. Read it here.

10.10 am: How's that semi-final spot looking for West Indies? Jarrod Kimber analyses their chances and the importance of Dre Russ in that XI. Dive in here.

Mashrafe Mortaza has won the toss and Bangladesh will bowl first.

Playing XIs:

Bangladesh: 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Soumya Sarkar, 3 Shakib Al Hasan, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim ((wk)), 5 Mahmudullah, 6 Liton Das, 7 Mosaddek Hossain, 8 Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 9 Mohammad Saifuddin, 10 Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), 11 Mustafizur Rahman

West Indies: 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Evin Lewis, 3 Shai Hope ((wk)), 4 Darren Bravo, 5 Nicholas Pooran, 6 Shimron Hetmyer, 7 Andre Russell, 8 Jason Holder (capt), 9 Sheldon Cottrell, 10 Oshane Thomas, 11 Shannon Gabriel

Jason Holder: Not too bad to bat first though we would have bowled first. But good opportunity to put up runs. You probably have to fight in the first 10 overs, which is what you expect, and we think we have the firepower to do it. Darren Bravo comes in for Carlos Brathwaite.

That means Andre Russell is playing.

Mashrafe Mortaza: We have been practicing continuously for the last four-five days, so the boys are well prepared. Liton Das comes in for Mithun.

Mustafa Moudi: "After all the Noise that was made after the WI tour of India, Hetmyer really disappointed when he got the chance to prove himself on a bigger platform. First IPL and now in World Cup, he is not able to play the way he is supposed to be. Hope today is his day !!" - he had a good little knock against England to be fair. Though he did sort of throw it away when set.

9.56 am: "Sunshine and a very, very small chance of rain, which we are not going to mention," says Ian Smith. This is not a very big ground, so the big-hitters will be licking their lips. Mel Jones, however, says the pitch should offer a good competition between bat and ball. There is a healthy cover of grass on it, but Jones reckons you could still see spin in the Powerplay to try and get it to skid on.

9.54 am: Lots of questions coming in about the pitch. Here's what Mashrafe Mortaza thinks of pitch-reading for his team - do it yourself, don't rely on outsiders.

Haris: "Hi Saurabh , hope you are fine . I want to tell you that last five meetings of Bangladesh and West Indies, four matches are won by Bangladesh from which three wins are from the recently held tri-series in Ireland. But in those three loses there was no Gayle ( universe boss ). So it was West Indies B team. So this match will be very interesting And hope that rain stays away." - I am perfectly well Haris, thank you. And yes, the head to head record favours Bangladesh, but they've played a West Indies team who haven't always had their top stars, making this particular match of a different timbre.

RAKESH SHARMA: "Hoping for a Gayle / Russel special today." - as everyone does (bar the opposition) when these two are playing. But will Dre Russ be playing? That is the big question. He didn't train yesterday, and Jason Holder said he's keeping Russell 'wrapped in cotton wool'. You can check out Jarrod Kimber's ode to Russell's knees here.

Sk Golam Saroar: "how's the forecast? any chance of rain today?" - it's England, so the chance of rain is never 0. But fortunately, it's unlikely to cause any major disruptions today.

Tommo: "As a kiwi, keeping a very close eye on this match... my head says Windies are going to be far too strong (unless Shakib can pull off another magnificent centrury), but I'd love to see the Bangers get up"

Duncan Ward: "Backing Bangladesh today - quietly going about their business and for me Shakib has been player of the tournament so far." - True, he has been quite outstanding.

9.42 am: Bangladesh and West Indies meeting at this stage of the World Cup is like a movie-like reunion of lost twins. Or at least that's what I say in my preview.
