Phew, hope everyone has their finger nails in tact. That's all from us folks, and this is Ankur Dhawan, signing off on behalf of Liam Brickhill, Shashank Kishore and Chandan Duorah. Good night and see you tomorrow.

Williamson: Nice to get across the line, the first half was outstanding the fielding was excellent. Not the ,most clinical effort with the bat. Few soft dismissals but a good experience to have in this tournament. Santner was outstanding with the ball, we were expecting a little more pace from the surface but guys adjusted to build pressure. The guys on the sidelines, there have been niggles, but they're improving.

Mashrafe: it was a good wicket, we were 20-30 short, the outfield was slow, I think we lost too many wickets after people getting set and getting out. Yeah, obviously, he (Taylor) was a set batsman but in the end we knew we had to get the wickets but credit goes to them for getting over the line. We still have seven matches left, we have to go one by one, hopefully we can come back next match

Ross Taylor is the man of the match: definitely, very nervous in the end, credit to Bangladesh, they put pressure on us, could have gone either way. the bowler's bowled well, but they kept putting pressure on us and we kept losing wickets but it was good to get over the line. Couple of close calls running between the wickets but I enjoy batting with Kane, hopefully we can run better against Afghanistan.

9.10pm What drama, another imperfect game produces a nail-biting finish. Santner holds his nerve to take New Zealand home. Heart break for Bangladesh and New Zealand go on top of the table. Both teams tried to outdo each other's errors and eventually Bangladesh succeeded. That's not to discredit a dramatic comeback by the bowlers, but it would not have been possible without the help of some of the New Zealand batsmen who gifted their wickets away. In the end, It was always going to be a game of what iffs after Bangladesh squandered numerous run-out chances offered by the pair of Taylor and Williamson, Mushfiqur botching up sensationally as he knocked off the bails with his elbow in his eagerness to collect Tamim's throw which was headed for the middle stump to reprieve Williamson. The running got better, Taylor was in sublime form and Williamson nudged to ball into gaps to keep things ticking. They lost their way thereafter as Bangladesh kept striking back and made a real match of it but that 105-run stand between Taylor and Williamson had knocked off a major chunk of the target and the tail just about wagged to take them home.

5.35pm These were the kind of totals Bangladesh managed in New Zealand lately, but there they had been jolted by early wickets and 232 and 226 were respectable recoveries. The problem for them is that New Zealand romped to wins on both those occasions with Martin Guptill, who brilliantly ran Mushfiqur Rahim out here, blasting back to back centuries then. He fancies the Bangladesh attack, averaging in excess of 60. The New Zealand openers made light work of a small chase against Sri Lanka, while they're chasing a few more here, the odds are heavily in New Zealand's favour. Not quite 500-1 but the bookmakers, according to bet365.com are offering 5-1, which is some indication of the work ahead of Bangladesh. But the pitch showed signs of holding up which should bring the likes of Mustafizur Rahman with his cutters and the spinners into play.##########"It was a little slower than we thought it would be," Mitchell Santner says of the pitch. "We'll have to watch out for their bowlers, but we should be able to chase this. My role when it's not spinning is to dot it up through the middle, built up some pressure, and we cashed in later, which was good. It will be pretty good. The score is maybe a little below par, but the cutters are gripping in the surface, and they have some pretty good spinners too."

Swarlok: "Well, it was not an impressive performance from Bangladesh team. That Run Out was the worst of all. Tough one for Bangladesh bowlers. Still they can do it if Mehidy, Mashrafe and Mustafizur's cutter cut New Zealand's batting lineup."

Taslim: "I think 244 is a quite competitive score in this pitch. Early wickets will help Bangladesh."

Albert: "Don't forget that Ferguson has now gotten his 50th ODI wicket aswell as Boult getting his 150th"

Henry to Soumya Sarkar, OUT, the breakthrough! And Soumya has given it away. He'd looked so good until this point, but he's undone by an ugly hoick into the leg side. Henry aimed the ball nice and full and Soumya looked to target the leg side, but the ball rushed on to him, taking an inside edge and bouncing off the pad onto the stumps.

Ovy: "A very bad toss to lose. Should hang in there for first 10 overs. Come on Tamim!"

Shorif Uddin : "Finally, the match time has come! It's a 'Eid day' (Biggest Festiva) in Bangladesh and I we are eagerly waiting for another gigantic victory in the eve of Shakib Al Hasan's landmark 200th ODI. I am from Sylhet, the City of rain in Bangladesh. To avoid all sort of problem, especially electricity, I have charged my two smartphones, purchase internet big data package. Now, It's only tigers time to show a memorable performance for their mad fans! "

Abhijato: "Mr Brickhill, you're shifting comms feed duties faster than India are shifting through the Proteas batsmen. What's your prediction for this one? You're a neutral here, after all, so no jinxes either ways. What's your take?" -- Oof! Tough call, but I reckon this could be Bangladesh's game.

Shorif Uddin : "Liam, would you mind informing us about the weather whether any possibility of incessant rainfall? " -- At the moment, it's set fair. As soon as that changes, I'll let you know

Bangladesh have a stiff challenge at hand given the overhead conditions and the form of the New Zealand pace attack that not only decimated Sri Lanka in Cardiff but also skittled India out for a paltry 179 in the warm-up at The Oval. On that note, it's time to turn over the strike to Liam Brickhill, who will take you through to drinks.

Rumman: "How is the pitch? Any grass? What you feel can be a par score? " It's a fresh pitch with reasonable grass cover. But in England, it's wiser to look overhead instead and there's a bit of cloud cover.

Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim ((wk)), Mohammad Mithun, Mahmudullah, Mosaddek Hossain, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mehedi Hasan, Mashrafe Mortaza (c), Mustafizur Rahman

New Zealand:: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson (capt), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham ((wk)), James Neesham, Colin de Grandhomme, Mitchell Santner, Matt Henry, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult

Mashrafe: Would have liked to bowl. It's not going to be easy but need to hang in there. Playing the same team

Williamson: We're going to bowl, it's a fresh surface. It was a good performance against Sri Lanka but you prepare and adapt for the new opposition. Playing the same team.

New Zealand opt to field


How Bangladesh began their World Cup opener against South Africa had a lot to do with the result. The man instrumental in providing that early impetus, Soumya Sarkar, reckons the first ten overs will be crucial again.

Zaman: "Good Afternoon from Germany Ankur. Lunch done, Boss isn't in the office, have a livecam opened which is showing lovely Central London with scattered clouds but nothing ominous to ponder the game as I can see, hopefully it remains so the whole game! Now waiting for a fascinating contest. "

Leave out Zimbabwe, and New Zealand have been Bangladesh's third-most regular opponents in international cricket. Here's Sidharth Monga on How two rivals have shown familiarity breeds respect

Zain: "From London Eagerly waiting to see How BD tigers perform today. Concerned with the bowling department and Tamims form. Recently he is quite out of touch. Today's match will prove whether BD a team just upsets bigger teams or they promoted themselves to the dominant force. "

SHAHED : "Hi Ankur, what's the weather there? If overcast, Bangladesh should field first given the chance. What's your opinion? " The weather's likely to be cloudy for most of the day but it's a tough one given that Bangladesh's spinners could come into play later. Besides, this isn't the usual 10:30 am start.

Bangladesh have appeared quietly confident about the fact that they aren't merely making the numbers this time, the comfortable win over South Africa only reaffirming that. New Zealand, on the other hand were so dominant in their opener against Sri Lanka that it's almost hard to know what kind of form the majority of their players are in. The Oval pitch has been on the drier side, which should suit Bangladesh.

"Vibe outside is boisterous," Isam thunders as he makes his way to the ground.

12.20pm Warm welcome to all of you for the second of our Wednesday double-headers. India are finally underway and are making a right royal mess of South Africa's plans in Southampton. Eighty miles down the road on M3, two "dangerous underdogs" have a great chance to prove they are genuine contenders. I'm Shashank Kishore Ankur Dhawan bringing you all the action from The Oval. Stay locked. Mohammad Isam and Sidharth Monga are our reporters at the venue today. Andrew Miller is on our #LiveReport.
