Srinath at our stats team tells us why England are so good. "An indication of why England's batting depth is so highly rated: since the start of 2016, teams have chased down this equation only 15% of the time. Our Forecaster is still giving them a 37% chance from here."

Kuldeep: "Hope Pakistan wins this. England's batting is already so dreaded, and if they pull this chase off, it will give that monster batting an even bigger confidence boost and will really make them nearly unbeatable this WC!!" It'll be a remarkable feat if they do, on the strength of just their lower batting order and Joe Root

Meanwhile, have a read of Osman Samiuddin wondering if Hasan Ali can get his early form back on track

Something in Root's eye causes a delay. Wonder if he's getting misty at the prospect of England not romping to the World Cup trophy unbeaten

Tasmeem: "Think Pakistan can sustain the pressure, Danyal? Pressure in a big tournament is a whole different thing even if you have got the World's best batting line-up on paper." Fair point. I don't know if they will, but Pakistan are in a better position than I'd imagined they'd be by this point.

Shadab Khan to Roy, OUT, Shadab pins Roy in front. The finger goes up, but Roy opts to challenge the on-field out decision. This looks pretty plumb, though. Pushed through on middle, Roy stretches out for a sweep, but this is too full for the shot. Has Roy snicked it? Nah, no bat involved and the UltraEdge confirms it. The tracker returns three reds and Roy has to go. It would have crashed into off stump. Tahir had got Bairstow early in the WC opener. Shadab now gets Roy. The departing batsman, however, isn't particularly happy. He has a word with umpire Erasmus before trudging off. Legspin with the new ball is England's Achilles heel

Pakistan will open with legspin in the form of Shadab Khan. Danny got his strategic punts right in his preview, didn't he? Tahir was the one who dismissed YJB with the new ball in the WC opener.

Dave: "I think the point re: Wood in for Plunkett isn't a bad reflection on Woody who's pace has caused problems, but more the middle over wicket-taking ability Plunkett brings is missing. Surely if you play Wood, then Woakes is the unfortunate one to miss out with the new ball? "

Bhargav Sura: "I am a person who believes in data. OK - Mark Wood can be bowling fast. But if his inability to take wickets is blocking Plunkett or Wiley from playing, then I think England are making bad decision. It is just like Bhuvi in Indian team. He bowls economically, but cannot take wickets. Plus Bhuvi's bowling average is much less than Wood thanks' to his economy, so he is needed in the Indian team to contain the batters. Wood's average and economy are obviously not that great."

George Dobell: That stumping might be relevant. There's been just a little concern about Jos Buttler's keeping of late. He wasn't at his best - or anywhere near it - at The Oval and he has been working pretty hard on it in training. But he completed that neatly and quickly and will, no doubt, feel a bit better for it.

Ali to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, Moeen finds grip and turn! Buttler takes the bails off and thinks he has his man. This was a beauty from Moeen. Drifts in from round the wicket. The flight draws the batsman out of his crease. The ball dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. The turn takes it past the bat and Buttler does the rest. Fakhar closes his bat-face and prods at it limply. The TV umpire has been called in to have a look at this. Fakhar can't drag his back foot back in time. Moeen provides England with the breakthrough

Fakhar Zaman st ((wk))Buttler b Ali 36 (63m 40b 6x4 0x6) SR: 90.00

Danyal Rasool: England's bowling to Fakhar has either been poorly planned or poorly executed. Teams generally figured out the best way to get him out was cramp him outside the off stump channel. Other than Woakes in the first over, that's never really happened. And too many balls have fallen right inside his arc.

George Dobell: Did England miss a trick not opening the bowling with Mark Wood? Certainly the prospect of Wood and Archer in tandem is attractive. It's quite rare for England to have two 90+ mph bowlers in the same team (when was the last time? Harmison and Flintoff, perhaps?) and Wood might well have enjoyed the hardness of the new ball every bit as much as Archer. But England reasoned that, if anyone was to get these new white balls to move, it would probably be Woakes. And perhaps he doesn't have the other weapons - in particular the pace - to compensate once the balls are a little older. Archer, meanwhile, looks especially dangerous to left-handers, so it probably made sense to give him the other new ball. As it happened, Woakes gained little - if any - movement, though he did generate more pace than he has managed for a while. He touched 90 mph himself at one stage. Bringing on Wood - who might well be just a little quicker than Archer - as second change also offers a bit of bite in the bowling just as other sides might be introducing their medium-pacers and should keep the batsmen on their toes.

Archer to Fakhar Zaman, 1 run, well bowled, and fast. 88 mph, short and popped up off the top of Fakhar's bat, might have been the glove. Balloons over the slips and goes through to third man

Woakes to Imam-ul-Haq, SIX runs, disdainfully struck over long on for six. I suspect he might not do that to Archer, but charges Woakes, picks up a ball pitched on a length and absolutely biffs it above the long-on boundary

D: "11 dot balls after you said "This is a good start for Pakistan", I'm curious to see your next assessment of the match." Oh dear. The commentator's jinx is famous at Cricinfo long before I started doing commentary

Woakes to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, excellent over from Woakes. Ball might not do much for him but he's ensuring Imam isn't allowed to get away like Fakhar was the previous over. England coming back after a sloppy first ten balls or so

Woakes to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR runs, slashed away by Zaman. Got just a bit more room, fuller delivery angling away from the left-hander, and a slice gets it just wide of the man at point.

Woakes to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR runs, sliced away to the offside. Looked too close to cut, and there was no timing, but surprising misfield in the covers lets the ball squirt through to the boundary. Morgan the man who misfielded

Chris Woakes to bowl the first over.

Right, the anthems are done, the goosebumps have tingled and then faded away, and now it's about how Pakistan bat (against a bouncer barrage, probably). Imam and Fakhar walking out to the middle.

Thank you, Deiva, I'll take over now. So even if it is early into the tournament, Pakistan find themselves with a game that isn't quite must-win, but one where defeat will make the ones that follow especially so. For England, can anyone threaten their inexorable march to the title? More importantly, can Pakistan?

Jawad Ali: "I think Pakistan has done the mistake again here. They should have gone with Shaheed Afridi in place of Hassan. He was capable of providing variations and short balls. In the record score of 444 by england at this ground Hassan was the leading score consumer for Pakistan." There'll be plenty of time for negativity, but the game hasn't even started yet!

Kash: "Is Sarfraz going to win ever a toss???" Or game, even. Who knows?

10.10am Wood lends extra pace and firepower to England's attack. Can he team up with Jofra Archer (your dream) and bounce out Pakistan like Oshane Thomas and co. had done a few days back? On that note, i'll hand over the World Cup cap and the controls to Danyal Rasool. And go say hello to Alan Gardner who will be manning the #livereport

10am Morgan and Sarfaraz make their way out for the toss. England win the toss and choose to bowl

Eoin Morgan: It [The pitch] looks very good. So, hopefully we play well enough today. We have one change: Liam Plunkett is out and Mark Wood comes in. It's because we want extra pace.

Sarfaraz Ahmed: I wanted to bowl first too. It looks a good batting surface. The short-ball v West Indies was just a one-off I think. We have played five ODIs - not thinking about the losses.

Pakistan: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt&(wk)), Shoaib Malik, Asif Ali, Shadab Khan, Hasan Ali, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir

England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(capt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler((wk)), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood
