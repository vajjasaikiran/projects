Bumrah to Mustafizur Rahman, OUT, THROUGH HIM! That's how it's done, says Jasprit Bumrah. From one exponent of great death bowling to the other! That went through Mustafizur before his bat could even contemplate its descent down to meet with the ball. Goes through between the bottom the bat and his toe, and goes on to hit the base of off-stump.

John: "Teams like Bangladesh and (Afghanistan) should no longer be considered minnows; the current players grew up watching and imitating the same subcontinent heroes of the late 90s and 2000s that the current generation of all other international teams did, perfecting their technique with the same rigour and intensity that others did. As a result, and with the experience and exposure over the last few years playing competitive and high-quality cricket, they are as good as any other team on their day."

Pandya to Soumya Sarkar, OUT, half-tracker laced straight to extra cover! Very poor ball, short and wide angled across on sixth stump and going wider, sat up for Soumya to crank anywhere he wanted. He didn't keep it on the ground and didn't get the elevation either though. Kohli is standing 17 yards away on one of the used pitches on the square and latches onto this with a bunny hop reaching up at head height to his right. 7/10 on degree of difficulty coming at speed and at short range but a sitter for the Indian captain's standards.

Chahal to Shakib Al Hasan, FOUR runs, goes for the scoop straightaway and connects! Good length ball on leg stump, Shakib premeditates this somewhat and seizes the line clearing Pant with short fine leg in the ring.

Regardless of how you interpreted an inside edge or not, it was a very risky/speculative review just on the height and line angling down leg. There was little chance of it being three reds. A poor review by Kohli when taking that into consideration and they get burned losing the review on Dar's interpretation of an edge.

Chahal enters the attack. Over the stumps to Shakib with no slip.

Mohammed Shami to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, short of a length on middle, tapped with soft hands into midwicket for a sharp run.

Mohammed Shami to Soumya Sarkar, no run, huge appeal! Given not out! Fullish length pitching on off and angled into middle and leg, Soumya is beaten going onto the back foot to defend. Kohli takes 10+ seconds before calling for DRS. Looked like it was missing leg live. Will be very hard to overturn with Shami coming around the stumps. There's also some doubt as to whether Soumya has sandwiched this off an inside edge into his pads. Third umpire Aleem Dar deems there has in fact been an inside edge and doesn't even proceed past Ultraedge onto ball-tracking. India lose their review and Kohli is furiously remonstrating with Marais Erasmus on field.

Kumar to Soumya Sarkar, no run, length, and outside off. He tries to drive this, but just cannot time it well. Is that a sign of how much this pitch has slowed up?

DBS : "Instead of criticizing India's batting all the time, it's high time we appreciate the opposition's bowling. England and BD both bowled extremely well in the end." --- I'd agree. The Pandya wicket was a huge turning point, I think, and that's where Mustafizur deserves a lot of credit

Mosaddek settled 15 yards in from the rope at deep backward square but produces a shaky effort reaching forward at neck height with palms facing out and fingers pointed up.

Shakib Al Hasan to Kohli, FOUR runs, tossed up, and on the stumps, and he whips this dismissively through midwicket. Supreme timing from Virat Kohli on that!

Shakib is back

MV: "400 is definitely on the cards...hopefully!!!"

Aditya Agrawal: "People are forgetting that it has already been over a month of High-Pressure World Cup tournament. Probably players are fatigued and mentally tired already. expecting 350 in every match is just getting overboard with emotions."

Avinash: "Is this match on the same trajectory as India vs England, solid start, then wickets lost between 30-40 and slows down the match and then Ben Stokes (Pant) comes in and takes game to next level" --- Not to forget a life for one of the openers. Although in that case, Jason Roy didn't go on to get a century

Rubel Hossain to Rahul, OUT, GONE! No century here for Rahul, as he looks to slash away a ball that was a touch too full for the shot he was looking to play. Takes the outer edge - may have been a change of pace too - and drops away to Mushfiqur Rahim's right. He takes a good catch low down to his right. It's not Rahul's most fluent innings in international cricket, but the volume of runs should do his confidence a world of good. He was in control for a greater percentage while his partnership with Rohit Sharma was on, incidentally

Mashrafe Mortaza to Sharma, SIX runs, hammered! A fraction short on off stump at just 130 kph, sits up for Rohit to lace a blistering pull over square leg. Flat, didn't go more than 15 meters in the air but clears that short boundary landing at 62 meters over the rope. It took India until the 50th over to hit their first six v England, but they've done it on the fourth legal ball today!

Mashrafe Mortaza to Sharma, no run, short of a length on fifth stump, Rohit goes back and punches but straight to cover point.

Mashrafe is really lumbering in during this first over.

Mashrafe Mortaza to Rahul, no run, good length ball on middle stump at 123 kph, defended on the back foot to short midwicket.

One slip in for Mashrafe bowling over the stumps to KL Rahul.

Final stats gem before the first ball from Mathew Varghese: first time DK, MSD and Pant have played in an ODI together. They have played T20Is before. And their record together in T20Is is not great! Just one win in six matches

10:28 am Right. Anthems done! Rohit and KL Rahul wait to cross the boundary as Bangladesh break their team huddle. Sparse crowd at the moment as fans taking their sweet time waking up and walking from the Bullring it appears. You're all awake and fired up at home and work though! We're happy to have you along for the ride!

Supradeep: "Why are India not brave enough to have a 2 all-rounders in? With DK at no.4 its a very good bet to play Jadeja. Drop Pant. He ie massively over rated. There is a better wicket keeper batsmen in the same class of U19 team he was a part of. Ishan Kishan is better technically, tempermentally and tactically. This is a wierd obsession of players with so called x factor and fast tracking them to a platform they are not ready to embrace. Its doing a lot of harm". Agree or disagree with Supradeep? I personally go for Jaddu only because for some bizarre reason I associate him with Hrithik Roshan. Jadduuuu, Jadduuuuu....

Quite a few readers have also chimed in about the history between Rubel Hossain and Dinesh Karthik, now that both have come into their respective XIs today. Could it be deja vu of the 2018 Nidahas Trophy Final? Well, it'd take some mindbending chemicals because after all, it was a T20 and India were chasing when DK struck 22 off Rubel in the 19th over to set up the thrilling last-ball six. But I see where you're going...

TVR: "Good lord, is India playing three wicket-keepers?" As recently as January, England played "three wicket-keepers" in a Test match v West Indies: Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler and Ben Foakes. Sounds sillier in concept than it actually is in reality. If they can score runs, pick em! And as some more commenters have rightly noted, India technically have four keepers in the XI today if you consider KL Rahul one along with Pant, Karthik and Dhoni.

Mashrafe says he would have batted first too. Two changes for Bangladesh too. Mehidy Hasan is out for Rubel Hossain. Bigger news is Mahmudullah has not passed a fitness test on his calf tear. Sabbir Rahman replaces him.

10.02 am Toss time! Ian Bishop says the captains are "jovial" standing next to him. Mashrafe spins the coin. Virat Kohli calls heads. And it is.... heads! India will bat first. Virat says it's a wearing wicket so they want runs on the board before the pitch shows signs of breaking down later in the day. Two changes: Kuldeep Yadav is out for Bhuvneshwar Kumar (which Kohli says is a selection based on the short boundary on one side, a major talking point post-match v England) and Dinesh Karthik in for Kedar Jadhav.
