Shaikh: "Okay, it's obvious now that Cricinfo aren't hiding the fact that this is an India centric site. Most commentary comments, even during this game which doesn't feature India, make references to the Indian team ("a robot style shot"), the majority of the comments shared are from Indians or people praising/referencing the Indian team. So what's the point, really? Do better ESPN." --- Knock yourself out with whomever you want to praise. I think most of it today could belong to Afghanistan

Ahmed Islam: "I am from Bangladesh and would love nothing but to see the performances of Shakib-Al- Hasan recognized by wining the Man of the Tournament, but I think the player who takes his team all the way maximizes his chance of winning the MOT. Although Shakib has been his best this tournament and also among the top performers, his chances of wining the MOT is not very high."

Nice and full, a half-volley by all means, and Rahmat brings his bat down in a lovely little arc and caresses it into the gap between cover and mid-off. Apologetic, VVS style.

Sheldon Cottrell has the new ball for West Indies. Just one slip

West Indies go into a huddle. Jason Holder has some words of encouragement to fire his team up, and the Afghanistan openers walk out to start this chase. Rahmat Shah will be at the non-striker's end, while captain Gulbadin Naib will take first strike

Sayed Shirzad to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, straight through the captain's hands at long-off. Bounces into the ropes. What should've been a wicket is now a boundary. He used the depth of the crease to get under the length and wallop this straight. The sun may have got in Gulbadin's way.

Adrian Meredith: "Pakistan in 1992 was dependent on West Indies and Australia fighting for 4th spot, then having New Zealand's abject hatred for Australia lead to New Zealand being happy to lose their final group game to Pakistan so that Australia could be eliminated.

Got it off the toe end and the long-on fielder ran in to take an excellent catch. It's that man Nabi, who at 34 is still as fast as they come in the outfield. Excellent anticipation, he was on the move as the ball lodged in his hands but had complete control.

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Lewis, no run, got into a terrible, terrible tangle trying to sweep. Huge appeal from the bowler and Afghanistan review. I think he's gone. This was fired in full, drifted in a hint and Lewis completely misjudged the length. Went through with the sweep but surely he knew then and there that he was dead the moment this hit the pad. Wonder why the umpire didn't give it out initially. Oh dear, oh dear. Guess what? Impact comes back as umpire's call and I promise you this was not more than one millimeter outside off on impact. How lucky is he to survive? Mujeeb can't believe his luck. Ball tracking says this would've smashed middle and leg.

James: "The fact that cricinfo lists Gulbadin as a bowler and yet he opens the batting is one of my favourite things about this Afghan team. When I was a kid I always wanted teams to put their worst batsmen out first, to blast as many as they could and then leave the real batsmen to score."

Tabrez: "@Shashank, the one problem with this format is, the teams who will not qualify to go ahead really don't give their absolute best in their last games perhaps due to lack of motivation.

Ajay: "I know my comment wont be published But can you guys explain the net run rate calculation for Pakistan qualification to Semi-final. If they restrict Bangladesh for 100-150 (RR:2-3) and chase the target in 10-15 overs (RR:10), wont their run rate better than New Zealand. Then why is everyone saying that Pakistan will be eliminated if Bangladesh bats first." -- It's what happens over the course of nine games that matters, and not a one-off result that boosts NRR. Effectively, Pakistan will rue their shocker against West Indies.

Confirmation then. It's spin first-up for Gayle. Mujeeb, with whom he's played some cricket at Kings XI Punjab in the IPL, will bowl from around the wicket. Slip in place.

Remember the World Cup Qualifiers final in Harare last year? Mujeeb bowled the first over, dismissed Gayle with a ripping googly. Will he open the bowling again? How will Gayle tackle him? Let's see.

Mouneesh Badam: "Naib really needs to perform today if he is to stay in his job as captain (or maybe as a player). Was really poor against the Pakistani lads" -- Well, he's still a young captain. Has gone alright with the bat. As a bowler, some of the best in the business have had a poor tournament. So let's give him the benefit of doubt. Did someone expect Rashid to have a shocker of a tournament?

saad owais: "Apparently there is news that the ICC has changed the formula for Pakistan to beat Bangladesh. The news is that if Pakistan make 350 then they need to bowl out Bangladesh for 160. Is that true?" -- Of course it's BOGUS.

10.25am Time for the anthems, and its 'Rally round the West Indies' first. Followed by 'Daa watan Afghanistan.'

10.20am Morning, everyone. Thanks, Debayan. Good to be back. Pity this game has nothing riding on it as far as qualification goes. At best, this is a re-run of last year's WC Qualifiers Final. All the players are walking up to shake hands and give Chris Gayle a hug at the team huddle. Wonder if that's a sign somewhere that this could be his last game for the West Indies. Yes, he's selected himself for the series against India at home but mind you, the selectors are yet to name the squad.

Arun Kamboj: "Chris Gayle has the chance today to become the West Indian with the highest ODI runs (overtaking Brian Lara). Would be a great way to sign off form World cups (or possibly international cricket) for the Universe Boss."

Shashank Maurya: "Our of the four West Indian players who didn't play in the qualifier final, two are Pooran and Cottrell. I bet these two will have a big role today. Ignore to my comment at your risk, publish them to get credit for my foretelling." -- Published, not because our first name is the same.

Dadrev Mupez: "Today is the best chance for WI to break the 500 run barrier. The Afghans have decent spin but I doubt they will give much of a fight." -- That's stretching it. They'll be happy getting 300.

Mohammad Kakar: "What happened to the Pakistan similarity of 1992 World cup!" -- Can be laid to rest now.

10.15am Just 15 minutes to the first ball. Time to say hello to Shashank Kishore
