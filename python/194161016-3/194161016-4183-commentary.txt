SD: "NZ's openers have been a problem area for them. This has made their batting heavily dependent on their middle order. In chases, especially big ones such as this one, you need at least one of the openers to get runs, but that hasn't happened at all for NZ. There is just too much pressure on these two right now, but they ought to be used to it by now."

A target of 306 is considerably less than they looked like posting, but it's still a tough task in the context of this World Cup...

Mind you... look what India finished on at Edgbaston ... spooky!

Justin: "Ahhhh of course bad luck caught them out against Australia. Not that they have a team of ultra aggressive batsmen who often fail in trying conditions, or an attack that is picked as much on its batting ability as it's inability to keep decent sides under 300, or that Australia actually outplayed them, or that England have failed in every major tournament for eons. Let's just stick with the bad luck theory....." Never said that. They were thoroughly outplayed by Australia. Their poor lengths allowed the Australian openers to have some luck.

Ramble: "As per Jarrod Kimber's article about left/right combinations, Santner bowls better to left handers, but has been held back from bowling to them by Williamson bowling himself, according to T20 wisdom about the ball spinning away from the bat. A good chance for Kane to try out Kimber's research?" If they had come in early, prior to the 30th he might have. I doubt it now. Maybe one or two when five men are allowed out.

Incidentally, my Camel CC team mate Brendon (a Kiwi though he disguises it well...) has seen a certain similarity in approach between Jason Roy and Nathan Astle. Lots of clean thwacking through the arc and all that. Astle's World Cup record, however, was truly weird. It started so well, in the very first match of England's two-decade-long stint of World Cup uselessness, but it rather petered out thereafter...

Nisar: "Any logic on playing Southee today? What are your thoughts Alex?" Ferguson is injured. And England's middle order feast on leg spin. Hence Sodhi was left out

Southee to Bairstow, 2 runs, an edge but it runs safely well wide of first slip, it would have been wide of second, third man has to run around from a wide position to cut it off. That was a good length and line, forcing a defensive prod

Southee to Bairstow, no run, 134kph, shorter length outside off, he's up on his toes and knocking this down off the back foot

Remarkable that this is Southee's first ODI since February, and only his fifth of 2019. Even more remarkable, given that he took 6 for 65 in that outing against Bangladesh! here he is. His first game of any description since the warm up game against India

NK: "With almost getting a second life at the first ball itself, I foresee Roy getting to three figures. What's your opinion Alex?" Roy has scored 13 scores of 50 or more in ODI's since September 2017 and England have won all 13 games. He is very important.

    Mitchell Santner1-0-5-0

Anurag Bhide: "Shouldn't Santner be signalling to the keeper that its going to be the arm ball, to prevent instances like those 4 byes first up? Seems like the keeper was expecting it to grip as well" Not sure Latham expected it to swing that far. It went a fair way in the air

Santner to Roy, 4 byes, nearly bowled him but it's four byes! An arm ball first up, he went back to cut but misread the seam up, it swung in sharply beat the inside edge and just went past leg stump and Latham missed it!

Here we go. Mitchell Santner has new ball. This was anticipated. Jason Roy will be on strike.

Thanks Andrew. The players are out there for the anthems.

Jim: "Please reassure me that one of the boundaries is only 59m and that for some mysterious reason only the side batting first will be able to take advantage of this." The pitch is in the middle Jim. Pretty even boundaries all around.

Sheeraz: "Are they playing the Pak anthem for NZ today? :D"

10.20am So, once again in an ever-evolving World Cup group stage, It Is All Up For Grabs ... here's Alex Malcolm to talk you through the first hour of action.

10.09am Lots of questions about the pitch. Have not seen an official report yet, but it looked straw-coloured and full of runs on the eve of the match. The key factor (despite the obvious conspiracy theories!) has been the arrival of the sun, which has dried out the decks that England were struggling on in the early weeks.

James : "Ferguson missing might be a blessing in disguise for New Zealand. CLS tends to be a kiss the pitch wicket tailor made for the likes of Southee and Henry. " It's a fair point. It's a place for the Graham Onions and Chris Rushworths of this world! But don't rule out Mark Wood on home soil either... or Liam Plunkett, back where it all began for him too.

rohan thakur: "Why do players take so much pain to complete the match when a game is decide by flip of a coin ? What kind of game it is , i am switching priorities , going back to works. Oh wait!! Who is gonna play India in Semis?" Well... presumably England, judging by that unfounded cynicism! But if New Zealand do win, it could yet be them ... with Pakistan vaulting into the top four to face Australia...

10.06am So, another day when England decide that batting first is the way to go. It's a change from their preference in bilateral series, but that's the pressure of tournament cricket. Runs on the board are crucial, and England are quite good at putting runs on the board...

Sagar Uprety: "There goes Pakistan's berth...it has been a bat-first-win-the-match world cup so far. Unless NZ restrict England to under 250."

England win the toss and bat!

"I think the pitch and overheads," [are the decisive factor], says Eoin Morgan. "The pitches have got tougher, slower, lower as the match goes on, and it's a trend that the pitches haven't been as good as the last few years. It's a bit like a quarter-final, we train hard, play hard, today is what it's all about."

We would have had a bat as well, but it's important to do a job," says Williamson. "Ferguson has been outstanding, but a hamstring niggle, hope he recovers quickly." Southee and Matt Henry are in, with Sodhi also sitting out.
