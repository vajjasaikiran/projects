106 needed off 117 balls, pitch not the easiest now, gripping and stopping. Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes at the crease, two of the most exciting batsmen in cricket. Malinga with the ball, one of the greats of the game. This game has come alive.

Malinga to Root, OUT, appeal for a catch down legside but the umpire is unmoved. They go for the review. Sri Lanka think they've had Root strangled down leg. Length ball drifting down, Root went to flick it but appeared to not connect. The keeper tumbled to his left and caught it, and went up immediately. And there is a spike! Root will be out. Malinga was brought back for this and he's delivered. Huge wicket.

Ryan : "Anyone know a shortcut to analysing batsmen standard deviations. very curious to compare say Root and Ponting. Similar averages but Root is phenomenally consistent (hence small sd to average) whereas perception is Ponting either out early or scores big..." - think you'll have to do it the old-fashioned way Ryan. No short cut that I know of!

So ipl like playoffs are fairer to the teams 1 and 2." - Will you feel the same way if the team you're supporting finishes 3rd, but level on points with 2nd? And because of net run rate or rain maybe, 3rd placed team has to play 3 knockout matches to win? While team 1/2 have only 1 knockout match

2.26pm Here come the England openers. Jonny Bairstow, fresh from a feisty 90 v Afghanistan, and James Vince, who probably could do with a decent knock today, just to reassure himself and his team that he's an adequate stand-in for Jason Roy... the extent of whose hamstring injury remains a bit of a mystery... Lasith Malinga has the new ball. Play!

2.23pm Vivek: "Heh, this world cup is reminding me of umpteen men's tennis grand slams from the past 15 years, where the only thing I'd do during the first week and a half was wait for the Fed/Rafa/Djoker/?? semifinals to arrive. " And Murray, don't forget Murray ... the New Zealand of the big four.

Parthee: "It's interesting to hear from David Willey who was not happy after his exclusion in the world cup squad and his current thought of England's performance so far in this world cup" I'm sure, deep down, he'd recognise that the selectors may the right call. He's got a busy County Championship programme to keep him occupied.

2.20pm Andy J: "Regardless of the result in this game, this is the 5th time in 6 games that the England bowlers have held the opposition to less than 300. All the talk before the tournament was about the England batting, but I think other teams will see that they aren't the one trick ponies people were saying before the tournament." I agree. Archer has added a new cutting edge, but so too has a fit Mark Wood. If Rashid can get the rip back in his action, England are well placed in the bowling front.

2.15pm Hello again, so, 233 is the target. It's hard to see an upset, isn't it? But you never know... that's the beauty of cricket!

Jibran: "Looking at the performances of different teams. The WC is essentially a 4 teams tournament!! The real WC will start with 1st Semi Final. " Sad but true. Though I do feel sorry for Bangladesh ... two seriously impressive wins against South Africa and West Indies, two hard-fought losses against Australia and New Zealand. Had it not been for a wash-out against Sri Lanka, they might well be in the mix still. They aren't completely out of it, of course, but they'll need to beat India to have a chance.

Amey Gupte : "This World Cup was set up with a very good format to be most competitive. Alas, the gap between top 4 and others (mentally and skills wise) is just too wide! The top have been table toppers since week 2 and that doesn't seem like will change - SAD."

Forecaster still says 231. I say Sri Lanka aren't likely to get that many either.

Archer to NLTC Perera, OUT, caught by Rashid diving forward at third man. The short ball works for Jofra, gets it to rise above shoulder height outside off, and Thisara has a slash at it, but without control. The ball flies off a top edge to third man, where Rashid takes a good catch.

Atit: "Early morning in US. Not happy to see 6 down but very happy to see Matthews is back. Hoping for 240-250 to give something to SL bowlers. Anything can happen in Cricket right?" - yeah it can. But Mathews is not exactly 'back'. This has been a fairly turgid innings.

Archer to de Silva, OUT, Root leaps to his left at mid-on and pulls off a super catch. Slower ball, leg-cutter at just 111 kph, pitched on off and moving away. Another mis-timed pull, it was only a matter of time before one of those went to a fielder. This one almost didn't, came off the toe-end and travelled to mid-on, where Root ran to his left and leapt up to pluck the ball.

Harris: "Is the forcaster down to 248 because of the Sri Lankans slow going? If so this has to be the first time i've seen this happen because of low run rate and not loss of wickets" - it is indeed due to the slow down. Forecaster takes into account the bowlers remaining and how the batsmen remaining are going to do against them.

Thanks Andrew. For those wondering about Forecaster, it's got Sri Lanka scoring 267 now. Competitive, but they'll need a few more to test this England line-up on what has looked like a beautiful batting surface.

Saoirse: "I love all 3 formats, especially Tests, but there's a very strong argument for ODIs being the best. It's not mindless slogging like T20s can be, yet it still has monstrous innings (see Morgan, or some late order cameos) whilst giving a more even competition between bat and ball. And on the other side it's far more accessible and shorter than Tests, and you always get a result. A perfect balance - never trust anyone who wants to discard of 50 over cricket!" If I look back on some of the things I was writing about ODIs in 2004 ... I can't believe I agree with this point of view!

Woakes to MDKJ Perera, OUT, slashed straight down to third man! Two in two and Sri Lanka are tottering already. Reminded of Jayasuriya's dismissal against Srinath that sent an entire nation into tizzy - albeit temporarily - during the 1996 World Cup semi-final in Kolkata. This was short, had enough width, he threw his bat at it to get a thick outside edge, this was in the air for a while, Moeen picked it early, took a few steps in, settled underneath and pouched it quite nicely.

Matt: "Batting first against England is weird. You feel that teams are under scoreboard pressure because they assume 350 is not enough." - True. However they fare in this World Cup, England have been revolutionary

Archer to Karunaratne, OUT, got him! It's that lovely, lovely line that does it. Archer has taken out the Sri Lankan captain with one that is moving away but bowled in the channel. Karunaratne follows it with his hands, it's bowled at the perfect line that just draws the bat slightly away from the body, kisses it's edge and goes to the keeper.

Woakes to Karunaratne, no run, cut him in half first ball!. On a length, nipping back in and hits his thigh pad on the way to the keeper.

10.27am: All in readiness to start. Pleasant crowd build-up too. Karunaratne and Kusal Perera striding out to open for Sri Lanka. Woakes has the ball, two slips. Over the wicket.

Pranay: "Most uncompetitive? Not by a long shot. Except AFG and may be SL, all teams are afraid of losing to any of the others. Count out WI at your own peril despite their waywardness and BAN have been fantastic. PAK is of course PAK. Real disappointment has been SA. As other biggies haven't really met each other, SA's matches were to provide the oomph in the 1st half but sadly that wasn't to be. "

10.24am: National anthems time.

Rahul Shrivasta: "Tell u what, Archer is definitely going to be in top 3 wicket takers this WC. He has an awesome career head if he just keeps his head grounded and straight" - from whatever we've seen and heard of him, he seems firmly grounded.

Vinod Rajpal: "Another England match with 100% clear weather !!" - the weather's coming home...

Angelo Mathews: it's been very tough and boring to be honest, not getting on the park, two games being washed out. Hopefully we can play some good cricket today. Apart from the openers, none of the batters have responded well, including myself. We take ownership for that and we'll look to get it right this game. We don't go out there to fail purposely, we try our very best, but unfortunately it doesn't come off sometimes. We've got to fight fire with fire with the English boys. They are playing their best at the moment. You've got to play positive cricket. You can't do much skillwork with the limited time we've got, it's just a mental shift that we need.

10.12am: We're soon going to see Jofra Archer steaming in - well he doesn't steam as much as amble - and letting loose his 145kph deliveries. There was a time when Archer was sleeping on the floor of his friend's room, searching for avenues to play. It's been quite a journey from that to being England's great World Cup hope.

10.02 am: Sri Lanka win the toss and bat first

Playing XIs:

England: 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 James Vince, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler ((wk)), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood

Sri Lanka: 1 Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), 2 Kusal Perera ((wk)), 3 Avishka Fernando, 4 Kusal Mendis, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Jeevan Mendis, 7 Dhananjaya de Silva, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Isuru Udana, 10 Lasith Malinga, 11 Nuwan Pradeep

Peter: "How can you call it uncompetitive. Four teams all with a good chance of winning. The favourites are magnificent on their day, but Pakistan have shown they can be susceptible to good opposition. "

Surath: "Dear SL team, doesn't matter what the result is, please try to bat full 50 overs today and that will make us happy. One step at a time. Thanks "

Dimuth Karunaratne: We've got two changes, Lahiru and Milinda aren't playing. We've had some time to regroup and discuss about what went wrong. We were worried about it (the middle order) but I'm pretty confident we'll bounce back.

Eoin Morgan: I would have looked to do the same, it's the best time to bat early. We've got with the same line-up as Old Trafford. It gives a little bit of turn, which brings Adil and Moeen into the game. Our first priority is to get into the semifinals and if we do that, we might look at who gets to rest. (Moeen) is absolutely buzzing today and thoroughly deserves his 100th cap.

Sri Lanka could possibly bring in Avishka Fernando and Jeevan Mendis, in place of Lahiru Thirimanne and Milinda Siriwardana. But we'll know in a matter of minutes. Toss time almost.

9.56am: It's a beautiful day, Wasim Akram says it's a "batting day". The pitch is hard, with not much grass on it, and Akram says the team winning the toss should bat first. Big totals expected.

9.48am: George Dobell tells me that England are going to be unchanged. So they're going to come full throttle at Sri Lanka. It also means Jason Roy has still not recovered.

RiwajAdhikari: "Well a SL fan from Nepal here and dunno why have I got a feeling today that SL can do this. Yes there might be some hiccups but hope the 'out of the box' tactic works in our favour to get the result for SL!"

Rahul Shrivasta: "So Swann says that England team believes even 500 is possible. I want England to bat first. Eagerly waiting to watch that happen. An Indian fan who really admire the current English team...."

Shikhar Pathak : "There will be some swing available in Leeds in the morning. If Eng bat first and SLanka gets 3-4 wickets in first hour, they might be then able to restrict under 400 " - whoa. That's looking at Sri Lanka's cup as - 1/10th full?
