Let's go. Get on with it. Players are back on, umpires call for play.......

7.00pm Play to resume in 10 minutes. Will be a 40-over game. Pakistan need 136 off 30 balls. The revised target is 302. "This is even beyond Dre Russ," Saurabh Somani belts out from the desk behind me.

Maaz Abbasi: "There should be a provision in a situation like this where both captains can agree to call play of. Doubt either India or Pakistan want to resume play and risk injury " -- Many other things to be considered here. Like fans, who've paid big money. Broadcasters, sponsors etc.

Azweer has a plea: "@ICC, Please shift few matches to Chennai, we need some rain." -- Savage.

6.52pm Live visuals from Manchester has Kohli chilling in the dressing room. He exudes the body language of someone who knows there's little chance of a resumption. Some of the players have changed into their training gear. Is that a sign?

Kartik: "Vijay Shankar's dibbly-dobblies warrant selection for the rest of the WC. Remember exactly how India won the 1983 WC. I see a Madan Lal/Binny/Amarnath element to Vijay Shankar's bowling. " -- I wonder if you've seen a lot of the 1983 film's build up. haha

6.45pm Good news, or is it? The covers are coming off. But that doesn't necessarily mean chances of play has brightened. They need time to take the covers off, which I find strange. Sometimes, it's almost as if they've taken longer to peel the covers off than the time play has been held up because of the drizzle.

We could be down to a few minutes before a final call. This is all but over. The crowd has thinned, the hover covers are on, it's dark and gloomy overhead.

Right, this has been an absolute pleasure, and the viewers have just poured in. I'm handing over to Shashank to take you through to the end.

06:35pm The rain has relented somewhat, but the covers remain in place for now. Even if they get them off, it might be hard to get play started before the cut-off time.

06:30pm Cut-off time, for those asking, is 19:15, which is 45 minutes from now

Abhishek: "Is there any chance for Pakistan, in case rain stops, coz I would have loved seeing a bit of a fight from here on, maybe a Pandyaesque innings to get them near 250-270...would have made things interesting, but other than that, hats off to Men in Blue, a near perfect outing, just hope Bhuvi's Ok, coz, his injury would cause selection headaches, more for his batting at no 8." I don't know what's less likely, the rain relenting or the Pak lower order showing fight from this situation.

Hammad Afzal: "What disappointment this turned out to be! From golden age of Pakistan cricket when Pakistan used to be the Asian powerhouse of cricket we have come to a time where India is so far ahead that these two teams simply do not constitute a contest anymore, let alone the greatest rivalry in world cricket!"

06:20pm Right, so rain has stopped play, and India will win by 86 runs should play not resume. We will keep you updated, and be back should we have further information.

Why not have a read of this cracking interview of Vijay Shankar in the break?

Satwik: "How well has Vijay Shankar done his job for the team. Stepped in at a critical time to fill in for Bhuvi." No question. Some of you were upset at how he batted, but he's had an excellent game.

And the rain is heavy enough to stop play. Pakistan are 86 runs behind currently. Par score is 252

Kuldeep Yadav to Babar Azam, OUT, through the gate! Incredible delivery from a supremely talented bowler. Everything about this delivery is the kind of stuff dreams are made of for a left-arm wristspinner. Nicely tossed up, the ball drifts away gently across Babar, pitches and then wickedly spins back in. Babar is looking to get outside the line to block, but is completely deceived by the dip, and then because he's played down the wrong line with a bit of gap between bat and pad, there's no second line of defence. Babar was worried about the wrong'un. Sneaks through the gap, clean bowled. Wow, what a ball. Magnificent.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar has the new ball. Imam is on strike. Two slips in place for him.

3.30pm Play to resume as the hover cover has been taken off. Out come the openers. The stumps are being put in. Let's get on with it. There is some blue in the distance, even though a heavy cloud hangs over. Hopefully it will blow over.

Pakistan's 20-over target: 97/0, 109/1, 125/2 or 146/3. This is if play stops exactly after 20 overs. As a chasing side, approaching this with one eye on the forecast can be mighty difficult. Do you preserve wickets, do you go for the dash and risk losing a wicket or two?

3.24pm The drizzle has gotten heavier and the players are walking off again. I'm not kidding. The sun is out but it's also drizzling at the same time. The main hover cover comes on. The Indian players have huddled together in the middle. The Pakistan openers are besides the sightscreen.

3.19pm Restart in six minutes. No overs lost. As a side, it will be interesting to see Pakistan's approach. Do they play for a 20-over target? Surely they should plan to not be more than one wicket down at the end of 20 overs, which will then constitute a game.

3.13pm The umpires are walking out for a mini inspection of sorts. The main hover cover hasn't been completely taken off. This can really be annoying. Erasmus is having a look at his clock and chats with the chief of the ground staff, who signals to them that he's possibly worried about the clouds from the west. (Looks dark, trust me). They know where the rain comes from. So we won't have a resumption just yet. The ropes have been brought out to mop up water on the surface.

3.09pm The weather seems to have cleared, at least the big cloud right over the ground has. The sun is peeking out, the covers are going off. But on either side of the stands, there are some dark clouds. Which really won't take long to come in. For the moment, it's dry. Let's hope it stays that way.

Right, we're moments away from a resumption. Welcome back, folks

Saurav, a Manchester local, with a dire message: "Rain started in Cheadle again (we get weather first, then it moves to Old Trafford which is just a few miles away)" -- Anyway, the players are walking out and Danyal is back to see off this innings.

Shankar (not Vijay) says: "Would be interesting to see how this break in play will pan out -- refreshed legs going in full blast or taking away the momentum from the intensity that was built up for the last 5 overs."

2.30pm The hover cover is coming off. We aren't far from a resumption. The umpires are checking a few patches inside the 30-yard circle. The stumps have been put in too. Full game. On. Start at 2.40pm. Mid-innings break of 15 minutes. No overs lost.

More reading, fun reading. We asked a selection of former cricketers, writers and senior journalists to pick their favourites from the opposition camp. You may or may not come out surprised.

A lot of you asking about revised targets, this is an excellent primer on how the DLS method works. Answers most of your questions.

Here's a clip of Kohli's innings for readers in India, from Hotstar. Reckon he can make a dash towards a century when play resumes?

2.10pm The square covers are being peeled off. Only the covers on the 22-yards and the run-ups on either side remain. The floodlights are starting to take effect.

Sampad : "I'm not in Manchester, But I'm keeping an eye by Manchester Airport Webcam. And its looking sunny near the Airport. "

Ram Kamboz: "This is just a shout out to Cricinfo....I have followed Cricinfo for at least 12+ years and you have kept me entertained whilst in the office and at home throughout many tournaments, no matter if it's a test match, t20 or an ODI. Humorous and Entertaining. Keep up the good work." -- Thank you. Readers like you make us what we are.

2.06pm Thanks, Danyal. Rain dance? What's that. I live in the era of the Naagin dance. The rain is easing off. We shouldn't be far from a resumption. The sun has decided to make another guest appearance.

One way for Rohit fans - or just cricket fans - (in India) to pass the rain break: watch highlights of his innings, on Hotstar

Right, to do the rain dance, now, here's Shashank.

For all of you wondering, if Pakistan have a 20-over chase, the target will be 184

Omkar: "If India don't get to bat again how much has Dhoni's wicket cost India?" Not much, it would appear. With Dhoni, the target would have been 328 in 46 for Pakistan.

So if India don't bat again, Pakistan will have to chase 327 in 46 overs. That's all for later, however.

Behram Ishfaq: "How heavy is the rain? Is it pouring or is it just some light drizzle?" It's a drizzle, but it's expected to get heavier at some point. We're supposed to have dry spells, to, though. So let's wait and see

and the players are walking off. The rain has arrived!

So while India bossed this innings, perhaps the rain came at just the wrong time for Pakistan, who would have had ideas about curtailing India below 330.

Anshit: "Can they take innings break's time gap right now just like in tests, tea or lunch is taken early because of rain?" They could, but we don't start losing overs for another 75 minutes

"Have to credit Sharma for this. He's usually a slow starter but considering the possibility of rain and DLS later in the game, he has already upped his tempo. Great attitude from a great player. A fan from Pakistan " He is a special talent, isn't he? Pakistan must already be wary of what's to follow

On the other hand, Aamir will now be under immense pressure to avoid another warning and may not be able to deliver as planned..." But early for all this, I think. There's rain to come, and DLS very likely to play a part.

Meanwhile, this is what the law says on running on the pitch: *Bowler running on protected area* It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his/her follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or not the ball is delivered.

Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul are out there. Amir to open for Pakistan. Action moments away.

Right, Pak Sarzamin and Jana Gana Mana have signed off, and now it's all about the cricket. It's a World Cup game, and two points are at stake.

10:25am. The teams have lined up for the anthems, one last jolt of patriotism before they're sent off to play. The atmosphere is spine-tingling, as you might have expected.

Chandan K: "Cricinfo's pre match build up has been relatively sedate. Any particular reason for this." Pakistan and India could do with a bit of calming down, don't you reckon?

Right, so let's remember hype aside, this is a crucial game for Pakistan. India have got off to a near-perfect start at the tournament, and a win today means they're likely just two more victories from a semi-final spot. Anything but two points for Pakistan, however, will leave them needing to win all of their remaining games.

"I don't think Danyal would want anymore warmth, even in his welcome considering the weather in Lahore. ;)," Huzaifah considerately points out. Too true!

Ajeesh: "Hi Danyal, which match do you think Pakistan had the best chance to correct that 6-0 reading in World Cup? " I think Pakistan had their moments in one or two, particularly 96 and '03, but it's never really been close, has it?

Thank you, Shashank. And welcome back to all of you, who are tuning in in colossal numbers. Imran Khan advised Sarfaraz to win the toss and bat, but the weather meant bowling first was always the safer option.

Alright, it's time for me to grab a cup of coffee. Please welcome Danyal Rasool, who is in Lahore. How's it going mate? Give him a warm welcome, peeps

10.02am Time for the toss. Tails calls Sarfaraz, tails it is. Pakistan opt to bowl. They are playing two spinners. Shadab Khan & Imad Wasim come back. Sarfaraz points to the overhead conditions as the main reason for his decision. Kohli too wanted to bowl first, but isn't too disappointed. Vijay Shankar comes in for Shikhar Dhawan.
