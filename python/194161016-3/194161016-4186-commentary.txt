Shaheen Shah Afridi to Mustafizur Rahman, OUT, bouncer-yorker combo produces the best ever figures by a Pakistan bowler in a World Cup! Majority of the people in the ground and at home had to know it was coming. Mustafizur had to know it was coming. But this is just too good tailing into leg stump and Mustafizur is helpless trying to stab it out while backing away. What a show put on by the teenager!

Shadab Khan to Mashrafe Mortaza, OUT, clever by Shadab! Mashrafe had gotten into the habit of charging and this time telegraphed it too early. Shadab responded by dragging this back shorter and wider well outside off. Mashrafe not remotely close to the pitch trying to cut it as the ball comes to Sarfaraz just inside the wide guidelines outside off and he shuffles back to the stumps to take the bails off with Mashrafe's back foot a half meter short of getting back in.

Mahmood: "Everyone talking about Shakib getting MVP need to realize his team did not do well enough. In NFL or NBA it is all about how the team ends up doing. JJ Watt from Texans does very well but never wins because Texans do not do very well in tournament. Same goes for NBA when Steph Curry won or James Harden won. Their teams ended up being on top."

Well the ESPNcricinfo commentary MVP is back. Here's Sreshth for another 10 overs.

Harsha: "Is it not naive is belittling Sakib contribution by ball. He has 10+ wickets and 500+ runs and many catches and run outs to add.can any one say has more in each department."

Wajid Jawaid: "The momentum that Pakistan has gained at the end of this World Cup will be lost if they change their captain after this campaign. With no other obvious candidate in sight and Sarfraz doing reasonably well, it will be detrimental to the team. The core of this team is settled. Just time to say farewell to Hafeez and Malik and give chance to some youngsters in their place. "

Mohammad Saifuddin to Babar Azam, OUT, yorker gets him on the toes on leg stump! Given and he's reviewed it immediately! Only doubt is whether this is sliding down leg. He was hit quite full and the review is showing three reds. He was struck in line with middle and leg shuffling across deep in the crease. Don't think he realized how far across he went. Very poor review. Seemed to be more that he did it because he was four away from a century more than because he thought it would be overturned.

another change. Shakib replaces Mustafizur coming into the attack. A chance for him to make a final claim for Man of the Tournament honors despite not being able to play the semis. But his tourney has been remarkable.

Mohsin Malik: "@Sreshth, Pakistan should Score 15 Runs in first over and choose Autoplay for next 49 overs to score in access of 500, like we do in Video Games."

Prasanna Kumar: "Pakistan should play a T20 Innings and get to a Test Match Score."

JANSHER KHAN: "Shuwair Sardar; Day dreaming should be illegal today"

10.22am Time for the national anthems. First Bangladesh's Amar Sonar Bangla. They are wearing a predominantly red jersey. After that, we have Pakistan's Qaumi Taranah. A lot of people in at Lord's - it's a sea of green!

jalal Anis: "I hear all of you guys. Couldn't resist making a comment of my own. I think the main winner in this WC is the "Toss". None of those top teams dared to take bowling after winning the toss. I wonder what would happen, had the toss won by the other teams, for example BD won the toss against India, Australia & England............."

chandana: "@Umar Farzooq It's not fair Sri Lanka also miss that opportunity after their success against Afghan and Abandoned Bang match as well. Meanwhile, NZ had a chance to beat India in their game with the form they had at that time. So it's luck bro do not worry... If miracles happen Pak can go to top 4. and Grab the trophy. "

Farrukh: "I am one of​ the voters who have voted that Pakistan will lose the game tonight. Simple, Pakistan is focused on winning the game with huge margin whereas Bangladesh is focused on winning this game and everyone seems to forget how good of a team they are at the moment. However, I​ do think the ​chance of my comment getting published is still less than Pakistan qualifying for the semis."

Ziad Karim: "Yes, Shakib@BD is at top of the Fantasy League Table. Go BD... "

TR: "@Sufyan: Unfortunately, a round robin format warrants that. Similar parallels to football clubs where you can win the league without beating anyone in the top4."

10.15am Shuwair Sardar : "Few world records are in danger today: - AB's fastest century - Morgan's 17 sixes - Rohit's 264 - England's highest ODI total - Zimbabwe's lowest ODI total - Vaas' best ever bowling figure - AB's fastest ODI fifty Get ready for the Surprise." -- Oh, that reminds me. How do you think today's game will go? Vote now on our #LiveReport now!

ARed: "@Saqib: Interesting point. Come to think of it, they won by 5 runs against WI. SA & Bangaldesh we're decently close matches. But they lost big against Aus n Eng."

Maryam: "Before the start of the tournament inzi had labeled hussain as surprise package for the other teams, its a surprise for me that the package is going back home unopened... "

Umar Farzooq: "The only thing that sunk Pakistan is that they could not play Srilanka while Newzealand played the match while Pakistan played India whereas Newzealand got away with that."

Sufyan Saqib: "although, it is a game of numbers and averages but NZ has not won a match against any of the teams in top 5 and still qualifies, is it fair method, whats your opinion. P.S i am just opening a new pendora box for fun :)"

10.05am Time for the toss. And Pakistan win the toss! Of course they will bat first. "One chance, we need to score a lot," Sarfaraz says. "We know the margin is big, but no changes to our team. The loss against West Indies was disappointing. But we want to finish on a high note."

Pakistan: 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Haris Sohail, 6 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt & (wk)), 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Mohammad Amir, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Shaheen Afridi

Mashrafe says, "we would've loved to bat first. Mahmudullah is back for Sabbir, and Rubel is not playing, Mehidy is playing. We've been playing well against Pakistan, but they are starting to take off. Won't be easy. It's my last World Cup match 100%."

10am Navin: Just wanted to pour in my opinion, In this edition BD seems a better side than Pak. If at all one team deserved to go to SF among these two, its definitely BD. But my heart goes out for Pak to win this game and by some "miracle" get into Semis, which is no stranger to them :) "

Pranay: "Is it fair to say that most of the teams who lost out on a place in the SF were due to their own undoing on the field with dropped catches? WI dropped a bucketful, and so did AFG and the rest. Imagine if Tamim had not dropped Rohit."

Shakib Al Hasan: All the games are important. Yes, we are out of the World Cup but it's an international game and we want to end on a high note. We played well consistently. We needed a bit of luck. Sometimes fielding let us down. Otherwise, I thought we played really well. Enjoying my contribution with both ball and bat - want to do it more often. Hope to continue in today's match as well. It is important for me to bat long up the order. Special to play at Lord's - the Home of Cricket. None of us have played an ODI at this ground, so will be exciting.

Vikram: "Let's shift focus to tomorrow's league games. Huge implications on whether Australia or India play NZ. I think both teams would prefer NZ over England given the current form." --- Nooo, not yet please! We need eight-nine hours of talking points if Bangladesh bat first

Asad Tirmizi : "This is the first time a toss is going to determine whether I watch the match or not!"
