Mohammed Shami to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, OUT, that's the hat-trick! Full, fast, and goes through the batsman again. Chetan Sharma did it in 1987, and 32 years on, here's Mohammad Shami, finishing off with two perfect yorkers, to win it for India! Mujeeb backs away and tries to go down the ground, but there was searing accuracy about that ball. India get their 50th World Cup win with that, but well played Afghanistan!

Adway Lele: "Does this trigger a 'rivalry' between Afgh and India? Why not? Every other Asian team has one!"

AJ: "This is ODI cricket. Requiring 6 runs per over is as good as requiring 15 runs per over in T20. Whoever wins this, but let the game be nailbiter."

Pandya to Rahmat Shah, no run, angles in from a length, and he defends from the crease

Varun: "Not impressed by Kohli's captaincy at all. Why is Pandya bowling. If you want to bowl fast bowlers, then your premier fast bowlers were bowling so well. If you're using up fifth bowler's quota, then why not bowl Jadhav on a spinning pitch. This match is anyway not gonna last 50 overs if you have to win."

Shankar, Jadhav and Dhoni can't even rotate the strike, let alone hitting boundaries. They negate the even Kohli's ability to rotate the strike continuously. And playing Shankar and Jadhav just because they can bowl is no excuse. Both of them are in the team for their batting and not bowling. "

What would have happened had that gone for 4 leg byes? How can batting side be penalized with a dot ball for what is technically an 'Umpiring error'." -- It's a dead ball as soon as the umpire raises his finger. Yes, it will come back to haunt some team somewhere when it's the final ball of the game and an umpire messes up. Honestly, I'm desperately waiting for that day!!

Rashid jogs to his right, picks up the ball, and has a clear chance of a run-out at the bowler's end. In fact, Rashid has way too much time, and he rolls the ball along the ground so that Gulbadin - running in from mid off - can remove the bails. But Gulbadin expected a faster throw, and he's on the floor, with the ball dribbling past his left.
