Mohammad Amir to Phehlukwayo, 1 run, full and on the stumps. Phehlukwayo tonks it down to cow corner, but there's a fielder there this time. Pakistan have won by 49 runs, and are very much alive in this World Cup

Wahab Riaz to Imran Tahir, 1 run, what was going on there? Imran Tahir blocked, and just set off like a man who had determined he would not be facing one more ball from Wahab than necessary, Direct hit would have been curtains
Shoaib: "What are the chances of getting into semis for Pak? It seems like NZ AUS has been qualified IND will .. is it race between ENG and Pak??" It's much more complicated than that, but if any team wants to get in from the outside, England are the likeliest ones to drop out. Mind you, not very likely, still. Would be a massive surprise

Wahab Riaz to Ngidi, OUT, he is now. Length ball this time which moved away, perhaps off the seam. Ngidi's bat nowhere near the line of its trajectory, and Pakistan are one wicket away

Wahab Riaz to Morris, OUT, does the job, as Wahab has for much of this tournament. 92mph, and while Morris might be good for a bash or two, that speed, combined with the leg stump yorker length, is just too good for him. Another nail in an already well-sealed South African coffin, you'd sense

Most lucky batsman category should include those batsman who get max chances by luck like umpires wrong decisions , dropped catches , missed stumps.

Muhammad Ameen: "Thoughtful question: Suppose if a left-handed batsman attempts for a reverse sweep and is hit on the pads. If the ball pitched outside leg, will it be considered pitched outside off considering that the batsman changed to right-handed stance while attempting the shot?" -- Since de Kock did not change his grip (like in a switch-hit), he will be considered left-handed. If he changed his grip like Warner or Maxwell, then he'd be considered as a right-hander for lbws.

Liam Brickhill: Here's the historic view: In the last four years, this ground has favoured pace ahead of spin. The seamers have taken 53 wickets at 31.3 here in that time, the spinners 22 wickets at 36.3 (and an economy of 5.6). So it might spin a little, but the seamers are usually the ones who make the difference here.

By the way - it seems like the TV and official scorers has missed recording the 2nd ball of the 14th over, which was a play-and-a-miss. Luckily for Pakistan, the 7th wicket wasn't a wicket, and luckily for the officials, the 7th ball did not add an extra run.

Hugh: "The reason for the soft signal for catches is because of the unreliability of the video evidence, due to the two dimensional foreshortening of the image.

Morris to Fakhar Zaman, no run, what catch on the boundary! It's Imran Tahir, and Morris doesn't quite know how to react. Did it carry? Short ball right in Fakhar's arc, and he smashed it straight to deep square. Soft signal not out. Given not out! Umpire doesn't have the evidence to overturn it

10.28am The Pakistan batsmen make their way out. Imam will take strike. KG Rabada with the ball. Two slips

10.23am Thanks, Danyal. Hello everyone - it's time for the national anthem. South Africa are in yellow, and first up, it's their Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika. Pakistan, in their green, are now singing Qaumi Taranah. A rousing applause as the anthems come to a close.

10:15am Right, the teams are just about ready, and we should have anthems in under ten minutes. For the first ten overs, Sreshth will take you through. Have fun, fellas, and see you in a little bit.

Omer: "It'll be interesting to see where Haris Sohail bats because if Hafeez doesn't drop a number it'll make him ad irrelevant as Malik was" Not sure about that, but Haris' position does matter. I wouldn't be surprised to see him come in at number five, with Sarfaraz dropping down a spot. But of course, it matters how many wickets fall early, and what the situation is when Pakistan lose their first two.

Sharda tells us the ground is almost completely full of Pakistan fans. At least 95%, she reckons. After some untoward incidents in the past few days, they need all the support they can get.

Saud : "Pakistan's Lebron is surely babar azam!! "



Kartik: "Is it safe to say this game is a dead rubber? Or we still living in some delusional world where both teams are still hopeful of making it into final 4??" Why would anyone be so eager to proclaim dead rubbers before they begin? No, this is not a dead rubber, not even a moribund one!

Pakistan have won the toss, and they will bat first. "Looks like a good batting pitch and some grass cover on it," he says. "We are not thinking about the pressure, just focusing on the game, which is very important for us. Haris Sohail and Shaheen in, Shoaib Malik and Hasan Ali out.

South Africa are unchanged. "I was going to bowl first anyway, so good toss to lose," Faf says.

Wajahat: "More interested to see Pakistan's bowling. This is something treat watch" They'll need early wickets, though, something they haven't managed in their last two games.

It's increasingly becoming clear Shoaib Malik and Hasan Ali will miss today's game, to be replaced by Haris Sohail and Shaheen Afridi. Osman, who's at Lord's for us, is fairly confident.

Waleed Khalid: "Staying up for an all nighter for cricket is much easier than staying up for exams... here's to hoping pakistan can at least attempt to make a turn around like the 2016 Cleveland cavs in the nba finals " Who's Pakistan's Lebron, eh?



Wasim Akram says the pitch has grass on it which should keep the bowlers interested, but firmly believes the winner of the toss should bat first. "Runs on the board in a pressure game matter," he declares earnestly..

09:50am The weather, you will be pleased to know, is as ideal as it should be at the Home of Cricket. The sun is out, the clouds maintain a respectful distance, and the teams are undergoing their last-minute warm-ups.

DentistMohib: "Well tommorow is my pathology paper and my preparation is not that much well but that virus inside me is not going to let me study with pakistan playing his all important match... And here i am :P" Well, best of luck to you. Both for your pathology paper as well as your cricketing-viewing aspirations. But mainly the latter.

Hello, everyone, to this must-win clash between Pakistan and South Africa, two sides who were expected to deliver so much more than they have. Defeat for South Africa will mathematically eliminate, while a loss for Pakistan will all but ensure they will accompany them on the flight home.

Keep us company here, as we bring you live action and regular updates, with the toss et to take place in half an hour.

While you wait, why not have a read of the preview? Osman's also put together a nice piece chronicling what's gone wrong for Shoaib Malik, unlikely to play any further part at this World Cup.
