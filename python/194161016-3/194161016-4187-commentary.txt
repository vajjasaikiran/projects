Thanks, Andrew. Your phrasing of "middle overs" reminds me of the old days - which most of you kids tuning in won't remember - of 15-over field restrictions. Can Sri Lanka summon up the spirit of the 90s and summon up a wicket now, with some choking spin bowling backed up by incredibly vigilant fielders at short extra-cover/short midwicket? For now it's Thisara Perera's rumbling seam.

Ganesh : "India have been brilliant in this tournament and their loss to England was mainly because of their error in strategy. On such a small ground we went with two spinners contrary to England who played with five fast bowlers. Kuldeep and Chahal went for 170 odd runs in 20 overs. Not only they were expensive also they released the pressure created by the fast bowlers. Also toss is becoming crucial and has a huge impact on the results. Bat first and take advantage of the slow surface."

Pandya to Mathews, 4 byes, sees Mathews shaping to make himself room and fires a full one wide of off stump, out of Mathews' reach. It's another slower one, and it bounces again before reaching Dhoni, and turns like an offbreak to beat him and run away for four byes

Jadeja to Mathews, no run, appeal for a stumping - did Mathews lift his foot? This is that most difficult Jadeja ball to face, the flat, quick one that spins sharply. Gets forward to defend but the ball pitches shorter than expected, making him reach for it, and rips past his outside edge. Dhoni, as always, is electric with the glovework. Where was Mathews' foot? Is it on the line, or is some part of it grounded behind it? There appears to be just a bit of bat grounded behind the crease, and the third umpire flashes the not-out sign on the big screen

Kuldeep Yadav to Thirimanne, OUT, down the track, and Thirimanne goes against the run of play. Kuldeep's slowness and dip does him in. Wants to make room and hit over extra-cover, but the ball dips shorter than he wants, and turns away. Ends up slicing it instead for a simple catch to Jadeja taking a couple of backward steps at backward point

Satvik: "India definitely testing their bowling department. It's jadeja vs kuldeep. Jadeja winning till now. Maybe India wants jadeja in place of kuldeep to go with an extra batsman against England looking at their deep batting line up" I'd back Jadeja as the better option for England. He has a long history against them too, which helps.

Although Jadeja is bowling well today, NZ or England will be happy enough to face him. Kuldeep was just the victim of short boundary and wrong timing. India badly needs Kuldeep in semis." Worth having the option though, as England didn't seem too bothered by Kuldeep or Chahal in their last encounter at Edgbaston ...

The ball dies on its way through to Dhoni, who takes another very good catch, tumbling to his left and taking it inches off the ground

Bumrah to Fernando, no run, big appeal, given! That big Bumrah angle, and Avishka has tried to drive down the ground without getting a stride forward. He's reviewed it, and the thing to look out for, I think, is whether it might have missed off stump. The ball went past the inside edge and hit the back thigh pad, so height may also be an issue. It's going over the top of leg stump, ball-tracking says. No footwork from Avishka, just looked to stand there and punch through the line, down the ground

Kumar to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, length ball, strays too straight, and Kusal nudges it off his legs nice and fine, to the left of Bumrah at fine leg, and it races away quickly, too quick for Bumrah to attempt the dive despite getting fairly close to the ball

Back over the wicket now.

Kumar to MDKJ Perera, 2 runs, oh my, miscommunication! That wasn't full enough for the big hit down the ground, and he ends up too far underneath the ball rather than behind it. Scoops it high in the air, somewhere between mid-on and mid-off, more towards the latter. Kuldeep, going to his right, drops the catch, and nearly collides with Pandya coming in the other direction

Bhuvneshwar goes back round the wicket to Kusal.

Bumrah to Fernando, no run, again he gets it to straighten against the angle. A little fuller, and Avishka is half-forward to play this. Squared up again, and the ball goes into the covers

Bumrah to Fernando, no run, length ball straightening towards top of off. Doesn't come forward, gets squared up and squirts his defensive shot towards backward point

In walks Avishka Fernando.

Ritangshu : "@Sri, Yes this is a batting heavy XI, but don't forget we only have five bowlers once again, which means Kohli will be in trouble if any of them have an off day. Don't forget India were in a spot of bother in the last game with Shami being targeted by Bangladesh. I would swap DK (if he doesn't perform well today) with Chahal in the next game. 3 pace + 3 spin options look perfect." -- I'd swap DK for Jadhav.

Bumrah to Karunaratne, OUT, gone, is it? Dhoni's convinced, and Karunaratne begins walking. Width on this occasion, but it isn't short enough to cut, and he plays it with an angled bat rather than a horizontal bat, and only manages a top edge

10.28am Here we go then. What lovely floodlight towers Headingley has. Kusal Perera and Dimuth Karunaratne are out in the middle, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar has the new ball, with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the slips. Over the wicket to start.

Hamim Emu: "And Mashrafee Bin Mortaza also. :-(" -- Oh yes.

10.23am Many thanks to Andrew Miller, who'd forgotten to fill his name in the "commentator" field, and hello, everyone. I quite like the look of India's team today, with a decent amount of batting depth. I'd go with something like this in the semi-finals, especially if they play England.

LM: "Last WC for lot of folks ... Dhoni, Gayle, JP, Tahir, Malinga, Shoaib Malik and few others who have not been named yet... can we have some guesses... Hafeez.. Dale Steyn..." -- Amla and Faf, I'd think. Ross Taylor, possibly? Maybe Angelo Mathews? Oh, hang on, he's only 32! Just a year older than Virat Kohli.

10.19am Nearly time for the anthems, so here's Karthik Krishnaswamy for the first time today.

Sri: "Even if we lose today, I don't care! This is the best XI with nine Indian batters. Top order can be happy to go all guns blazing from the word GO! Else we have to fear about long tail and keep taking singles. So best XI to beat Eng or any others is this Ind XI"

Satish: "@Damian: If srilanka was the team of past with the likes of Sanga and Jayawardene, people would have been equally afraid of the team. But somehow the current team doesn't have that fear factor to them. There is a lot to improve with the current team, you have to agree with that." But they've still got Malinga, and in Avishka Fernando, they've found a star for the future too ...

10.12am Whatever else transpires today, we will surely be witnessing the last hurrah at a World Cup of a true legend of the game. Lasith Malinga, two-time World Cup finalist, World T20 winner, and arguably the man to thank for making this such a thrilling World Cup group stage, after his sensational take-down of England last month. Andrew Fernando will have his crayons out again at some stage no doubt to splash more colour on one of the most colourful cricketers of his generation. But here's one he wrote earlier for the time being...

Sidban: "I agree with your point regarding rhythm at this stage of the tournament, but feel that Bumrah is probably the only bowler in world cricket who doesn't need practice to get into rhythm like Bhuvi, Shami et al. Even when he comes back from injuries, he bowls as if he has never been away. Hence I concur with Akhsat's view that Bumrah could've been rested considering India's tight schedule at the business end of this tourmanent."

Damian Raktha: "All comments are all for India, trest SL like a minor, SL has won 50 ovrer and t20 wc and 5 time runners up in 50 and 20 over WC. WC head to to SL 4 and India 3, still cricicinfo only outs pro Indian comment and treat SL as if they don't exsist. Shame on u cricicinfo. Unethical " Well, send some comments in then! Preferably non-chippy ones, but I'll publish anything going in the meantime...

10.07am Akshat: "Bumrah should have been rested. He has been playing for too long." It's an interesting balance to strike, isn't it? Australia were discussing similar last week, but realistically at this late stage of the tournament, rhythm is as important as rest. The possibility of three games in eight days shouldn't be too daunting, even after a tough campaign.

Notable news for fans in the UK - the World Cup final could be shown on free-to-air if England make it through their semi (potentially against India). But in the meantime, a different World Cup has been capturing the public imagination this summer. Here's Sharda Ugra on how men's cricket lost to women's football in the UK.

Onkar: "I think that's perfect setting for India - in this 'no worries' encounter. Win toss and and win match has been Mantra throughout the world cup. But in knock out stage - we may face such situation and what a way to prepare against weaker opposition like Sri Lanka. Overwhelming quality in all three departments should see India through. "

Channa Kariyaw: "@Onkar : This was the exact mindset England played the match against SL.And you know the rest..:)"

Adarsh: "Tomorrow is Dhoni's birthday. Sri Lanka is his favorite opposition. His most memorable innings in the World Cup came against them. So expect Dhoni to play a good innings today. " Noted...

Sri Lanka win the toss and bat first

Thisara comes in for Vandersay

Kohli says he would have batted first too. "The team is really striking a good balance, it's about performing at the big times."

Two changes for India, as flagged by Nagraj. Chahal is rested for Kuldeep, and Jadeja comes in for Shami

India: 1 Rohit Sharma, 2 KL Rahul, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 Rishabh Pant, 5 MS Dhoni ((wk)), 6 Dinesh Karthik, 7 Hardik Pandya, 8 Ravindra Jadeja, 9 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 10 Kuldeep Yadav, 11 Jasprit Bumrah

Sri Lanka: 1 Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), 2 Kusal Perera ((wk)), 3 Avishka Fernando, 4 Kusal Mendis, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Lahiru Thirimanne, 7 Dhananjaya de Silva, 8 Isuru Udana, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Kasun Rajitha, 11 Thisara Perera.

10am Right, it's time for the toss ...
