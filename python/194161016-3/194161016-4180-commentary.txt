Malinga to Thomas, OUT, appeal for lbw but not given. Full, on leg stump, and the ball did hit his pad. Malinga reviews. Was there inside edge? Or did it land outside leg stump. Only one of those two things can save Oshane. Replays show that it lands on leg stump, takes no edge of the bat, and hits him on leg stump. What does ball tracking say? Crashing into leg stump! Umpire Oxenford has to reverse his decision...

Allen was ball-watching, and when he saw Pooran reach the other end, he scampered across to ensure that Pooran isn't run-out. Allen sacrifices his wicket, but did West Indies need to throw a wicket away at this stage? Probably not...

Sarah : "The problem with windies is that they look to transfer T20 skills to ODI cricket in the wrong way. It's highly plausible to transfer those skills ... in the last 20 overs of an ODI, not the first 20 like the windies has been doing. They tended to bat strongly in the first 20 overs and fall away in the last 30. But if they were to play proper ODI cricket in the first 30 overs and apply T20 cricket to the last 20, then they would for sure be a force to be reckoned with "

Want to clarify that SL are eliminated since they will have one less win than ENG or IND or NZ even if they get 10 points. And 'number of wins' is the first tie-breaker between the teams that are tied on points. Net Run rate is the second tie-breaker. And here's Shai Hope for West Indies. Two slips

With my vice-captain Gabriel failing in the first innings, I desperately need a high score from my captain Shai Hope! And as we speak, the Sri Lankans join in for a huddle to begin the second innings.

Prabath Perera: "Who is the youngest player scored 100 in a world cup?" -- Paul Stirling (Ire v Netherlands, 2011). Second is Ricky Ponting (AUS v WI, 1996) and third is Avishka today.

2.50pm Still a fair amount of time for the second innings to begin, but we welcome you back to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of SL v WI. While we wait, enjoy Sidharth Monga's notebook entry from England

Habeeb: "As a SL fan this score is really good given our past performances. However, given the position we were in around the 35th over etc you would have thought that they could have scored 20-40 runs more?? Or am I just being too harsh??" -- Tad too harsh, mate! They hadn't crossed 250+ till today in this WC

Thomas to Thirimanne, 1 run, just missed out, did the batsman. It was there to be deflected past short third, but went straight to him

Sharda Ugra: Let it be said this is a Dementor press box. Andrew Fidel Fernando and I went out onto the balcony/overflow area to watch Avishka get to his century, and Riverside was a bundle of noise, music cheering and fun. Avishka's celebration was joyous - the flags were flying ghosts in Lumley Castle must have been applauding from their turrets… We return from the balcony, lifted by the atmosphere, the 'dead' game not so dead in how it was being received by the spectators, open the door to the press box and. SILENCE."

Cottrell to Fernando, OUT, slower ball, and that brings the innings to an end! Cottrell salutes him off, and for once, it looks like a compliment rather than a send-off. Struck way too low on the bat and ballooned to long-off instead of getting distance on it. 104 off 103. It's au revoir, Avishka, definitely not adieu

We don't want a listless macho-man-type one-sided campaign of 2003/2007-Australia or 2011-India.

Ambris gives the ball a mighty chase, but rolls his left ankle while trying to field it. Was his hand touching the rope when he retrieved the ball though? The TV umpires are checking on that while the physio checks on Ambris. Nah, Ambris did a good job fielding although he's now off the field for a check-up

Rajinder: "Avishka should be told 60 is good but he has to get 160 for the teams sake . "

Billy: "@Sarah - Definitely agree those are nominees too. But what stands out in Stoke's catch is that he was not facing the direction of the ball. People thinks that is just fluke. But for me it had more technique to be just fluke. The way his elbow was bent to absorb the pressure of the ball hitting the palm is just one of it."

Romesh: "@Billy Stokes misjudged initially and made it looked spectacular and English media exaggerated it. There are quite a few good catches like Cotrell, Woakes, Jadeja if you look for difficulties but not Stokes one."

Gabriel to Mathews, 2 runs, back of a length, on off, and he pulls uncomfortably. Falls just short of the fielder at midwicket, and the a(wk)ward bounce means that it's a misfield. Another two runs for SL, and while the throw is a direct-hit, the players were in. The bails, though, flew and hit Gabriel's face

bit of a delay. Gabriel is sending midwicket to short cover, and mid-on comes to midwicket

Gabriel to Fernando, 1 run, length ball angling in from outside the stumps. He sticks his bat out and chops a shot down to third man

Billy: "@ Sreshth - I think that catch from Allen looked sophisticated due to the acrobatics and not necessarily for the level of difficulty. We have seen tougher catches in other games which are better nominees for the catch of the tournament. But for me nothing has beaten Stokes yet." -- and here's Gabriel once again. He has seven overs up his sleeve

Sharda Ugra: that Avishka boundary with which he got to his 50 is the longest in the strangely shaped ground. A bit of a delay as the umpires change the ball.
Rocky Charles: "To be frank, expected high calibre cricket from West Indies at this WCC. But in some matches it was hard luck as they could have nearly scrapped through and in some matches just played irresponsibly. They need to bring back the glory of the 70s-80s. Wishing them good luck."

Faisal Jaan: "How different could this WC be if Dre Russ hadn't played that rash shot against Aussies, or WI could take Shakib's wicket early in BD's big chase, or South Africa game wasn't washed out when WI had them 25 odd for 2, or Carlos Braithwaite's could find muscle worth an extra meter against NZ. Points table will never justify what happened on ground. "
Kalyan: "Captain getting captain is very rare, given that historically not many have been bowlers, but holder seems to be getting an awful lot of captains wicket...kudos"

If England loses the match with a big margin and SL wins both the matches with a big margin, then there is still a possibility for SL to qualify. Isn't it? Or I am missing something?" No, at 10 points, like I said, number of wins is the tiebreaker. And SL have 2 points from rainouts
