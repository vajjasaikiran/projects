6.35pm: Okay, that's your lot for this one. Sheriff Morgan and his six-shooter laid down the law at Old Trafford today, and sent his team riding off into the sunset with the points. Afghanistan battled admirably, and have some plusses to take into their next match against India (gulp!), but this was as comprehensive as results come. We'll have Danyal's report on the site soon, and join us again tomorrow for a real crunch clash, New Zealand v South Africa at Edgbaston, a game around which the whole tournament could pivot. From myself, Varun and Thilak, it's goodbye for now!

6.25pm: Time for the captains, starting with Gulbadin Naib: "Yeah, obviously how they played, [Morgan's was] one of the best innings I ever seen. Our plan when we saw the wicket, different to the last four games, it suited the spinners and Mujeeb did a good job. Unfortunately Rashid was expensive, not at his best, so England scored around 400. We did a lot of good things but we dropped Morgan, so this is the main point for us. We work hard in every department and are improving day by day, but we have work to do. [Attempting to chase?] Big target but our message was play your normal game, don't think about win or lose, play the 50 overs. Maybe we then have a chance. We played 50 overs, so that's a good thing for our batters."

Morgan is back for more: "Our next two three games are crucial. Want to bring our intensity to every game, we were at the top of four game today. If we can bring that to Headingley against Sri Lanka, then we go on to play Australia in good form. I think the intensity can still be there, you can still produce mistakes. [Dropped catches?] We did spill a couple of catches, which can happen, hopefully it doesn't continue. But I can't fault the guys. [Archer and Wood?] Throw Stokes in there, bowling 90mph as well as the moment. Having guys competing that level is amazing."

6.15pm: England go top of the table, while Afghanistan stay rooted to the bottom. There was a mini pitch invasion at the end there, with one Afghan fan taking a selfie with some of the England players, apparently. They are just happy to be there - and happy their side batted through a full 50 overs, which is a decent milestone for them, giving they had a snowball's chance in hell of making 398. It was a decent outing for the England captain, too, amid a record-breaking deluge of sixes - fittingly, Morgan's 148 was pretty much the margin between the sides.

For that knock, Eoin Morgan is named Man of the Match: "Today was a fantastic day for us, and I managed to have a day out, which was great,. The wicket was good, we bowled well in the first ten overs, our openers batted really. A good day all round. I didn't think it was going to be my day. Hobbling around with a bad back, didn't think I'd produce an innings like that. Makes it a bit more special when i can compete with the youngsters in the side. It was nice. It started out as a tough game, Afghanistan are a side with potential, so it's nice to do it on the big stage. [Used to play more funky shots?] I think I have changed, everybody plays the shots I started my career with, so that they're not as effective. I'm probably stronger down the ground now than I ever have been. [Back okay now?] Yeah, tomorrow's going to be a rough day."

Here's PaulCC: "Don't agree with the poster that said bowling is still weak for England. I think they've bowled pretty good on a great batting surface - the pace and accuracy of Wood has been very impressive - Woakes has hardly bowled a bad ball. Stokes, Ali & Archer have done their jobs well. Yeah Afghanistan are 200 odd for 5 but they have hardly chanced their arm this game going at under 5 rpo. England let themselves down slightly in the field with those 2 catches." All seems pretty reasonable

He takes his eyes off it and gets it smack on the back of his head. He's currently on the floor..back on his feet. Gentle applause from the crowd. Medical staff from both camps are tending to him, it appears. He looks disoriented...and so does the bowler, actually. He's waiting for a new helmet to arrive, says Sharda from the ground. Good signs so far...although immediate signs are not always accurate signs with such injuries. He's got a new helmet on. He will bat. Off go the doctors.

2:06pm Well, here it is. The kind of innings that was expected every other day this World Cup. It's taken a few weeks, but boy, if you needed anything to shake you out from the funk of all the rain delays, this did it. 142 runs in the last ten overs. That's how many England got. Morgan, dropped on 28, made 120 off his next 45 balls. He hit 17 sixes, the most by any batsman in an ODI, and fueled another record - most sixes by any team in an ODI. England held that previously with 24. They've hit 25 today. Eleven of those came off Rashid's bowling - yet another six-related record as he got the worst figures in a World Cup. that is the story of the innings. Just some unreal hitting from a team that was going at just above 5 for a big part of the innings. Root with neat little 88 to support Morgan, and Bairstow before him, who made 90, would have been the stars on a normal ODI day. We are beyond normal now. The chase shortly.

Dawlat Zadran to Ali, SIX runs, drilled over wide long-on! Oh boy. 25th six. Most in an innings, ever, beating England's own record. Length ball on leg stump, gets the front leg out of the way and sends it sailing

Dawlat Zadran to Ali, SIX runs, smoked over square leg! Gosh! Exactly the shots coaches train out of toddlers - front leg facing square leg, back leg rooted, head in the leg side, ball on the off. But those hands...phew. Clean swing as this slower ball rises up for him and he nails the connection

Rahmat Shah to Bairstow, SIX runs, pumped straight! Full and flat just outside off. Bairstow to the pitch quickly, helped by the flatter trajectory too, and a nice, sweet hit - about 85 metres

Hugh: "@Ghairat not so fast? England's attack has been the fastest in the tournament so far. Both Wood and Archer are regularly over 90mph and Stokes' has been regularly getting over that mark too."

Rahmat Shah to Bairstow, no run, beats the outside edge. The perfect legbreak to start. Drift, dip, and a good length outside off drawing Bairstow in before getting it to jump past the edge

Here is Rahmat. Afghanistan's best batsman, arguably, but someone who went through the junior ranks rated as a very potent legspinner

Ghairat: "I never understand Afghanistan's game plan. Today was the day for Zazai to express himself on a good batting track against not so fast bowlers (apart from Archer), and they dropped him , while there is no opener included to replace him. Unbelievable and at the same time frustrating. "

Seth Miller: "I hereby petition to change Naib's tag from rmf to rvvs (right arm very very slow). I mean seriously a seamer bowling a ball at 100 kph!!" --- I'm all for it! (His pace and the designation)

10:28am Cheers, Alan! If I had the new ball against James Vince, I'd lob a few up just to see that cover drive. Probably why I have played no competitive cricket whatsoever. Unlike young Mujeeb, who has the actual new ball in hand at a World Cup as Vince marks his guard.

Alan Hardy: "If Vince gets a good score today, doesn't flatter to deceive with a few glorious cover drives then an edge to slip, it will stand him in good stead for consideration for the Ashes..." --- #TeamVince

>

10.20am: Right, this should be fun. We've also got Danyal on the Live Report today, if that's your sort of thing... And I'll now hand over to Varun, who's limbering up to take the new ball.

"Hey Dave, England is looking for 500 plus score today in an ODI & an individual double ton by one of the openers!!" squeals Vinod Rajpal

"Disappointing not to see Curran get a run today...what is the point risking Wood, when in his BBC column he admitted to having bruised feet and icing himself every hour to play?" Interesting point, Mark. There would certainly seem to be value in getting Curran involved sooner rather than later

10.10am: So England will have first dip, in the knowledge that this used pitch will likely slow down through the day. India defended 330 pretty convincingly against Pakistan on Sunday, so it will be England's task to try and work out what they think is enough (and quiet those at the back sniggering "200 should do it"). Afghanistan have only chased once in the tournament so far, when they cracked under pressure against Sri Lanka, though this surface looks like being the most receptive so far to their skills.

"So we have batsmen injuries and there's rain about (it IS Manchester) so are looking for quick win...and we BAT? Am I missing something?" I think the forecast is okay today, dave meneer. And runs on the board has been the best strategy at this tournament so far (notwithstanding Shakib's heroics yesterday...)

Abdul, meanwhile, is a little peeved: "Why Why Naib?//Hazratulllah Zazai has scored more runs when compared to Rahmat Shah or Hasmatullah in the last 4 innings. NO Shahzad or Zazai no X-factor in Afghanistan team."

10am: England win the toss and bat, Vince and Moeen are in, says Morgan. "The wicket looks really good, with the weather that's been around everyone at OT has done a magnificent job getting things ready," he says. Gulbadin Naib also wanted to bat, calling this an "Asian condition wicket". They have made three changes, dropping Hazratullah Zazai, Hamid Hassan and Aftab Alam, with Najibullah Zadran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Dawlat Zadran coming in. "Slightly disappointed with the batting, guys are trying to do well and put a good total on the board," adds Naib, who according to the teamsheet will be opening alongside Noor Ali Zadran! Afghanistan rolling the dice here, it seems.

Afghanistan: 1 Noor Ali Zadran, 2 Gulbadin Naib (capt), 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi, 5 Asghar Afghan, 6 Najibullah Zadran, 7 Mohammad Nabi, 8 Ikram Alikhil ((wk)), 9 Rashid Khan, 10 Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 11 Dawlat Zadran

England 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 James Vince, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler ((wk)), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood.

9.59am: Morgan is doing the toss, reports George. Sounds like Liam Plunkett might be missing out, too, having suffered a stomach upset the other day.

9.55am: Right, toss coming up shortly. Will Morgan be there? Have Afghanistan seen sense and included their best batsman? We'll find out in 5, 4, 3... Plus we've got the usual Match Day magic for you below

9.45am: George Dobell has spotted Eoin Morgan "warming up as normal", which would be a boost for England, who are already without Jason Roy for this game. James Vince is set to cover, though England haven't entirely ruled out going back to Cricket Bad Boy™ Alex Hales if Roy doesn't recover quickly (see SM below). If Morgan wasn't fit after a back spasm against West Indies, then Moeen Ali would likely come in - though that would jigger up the balance of the side, somewhat. Moeen could play anyway, if England go back to three seamers and two spinners (plus Stokes and Root).

Here's Varahan: "My bold prediction for today: If put into bat, Afghanistan plays out the entire 50 overs!! How about that for a start Afghanistan? Come on Afghan, anything is possible in sports." Live the dream, bat 50 overs... They are pretty much the same thing

"Alan, how did Sharda Ugra enter the venue," wails Kartik Aiyer. "Banish her as soon as possible or else she will bring rain." Don't worry, I think the rainmaker might be about to break her run of ducks-in-puddles

9.35am: "Greetings," says Sharda from Old Trafford, where "the sun is shining, the steel band drums can be heard from the OT tram stop and a good number of England fans were coming in as early as 8.45am. There is a strong hint Hamid the superstar wont be playing and Mujeeb mercifully will." That all sounds intriguing. Hopefully somewhere in all that is spark to get the underdogs barking at this World Cup, after a somewhat predictable group stage so far.

Here's SM, who's spotted a cloud on the horizon for the hosts: "England's prognosis of Jason Roy's injury seems optimistic. I can't see him making an appearance for group stages. And that is going to be the difference between England finishing top or second (behind India) in the group stages. And Roy always looks scratchy when he comes back from a lay-off so this is potentially huge for England's chances of winning the tournament"

"I hope our Afghan readers understand the John Prescott comment," muses George. "Such a world figure is surely known in every corner of our planet - or maybe not." Old Two Jags is doubtless known everywhere as a true man of the people

9.25am: Okay, let's be having you, Afghanistan. Us cricket fans are of a romantic bent, and we need some action, dammit. You've been knocked down a few times already this tournament, but it's time to give it your best Chumbawamba impression and pour a bucket of cold water over John Prescott England. The sun is shining in Manchester (at least according to Sharda Ugra) and, whisper it, this could be a pitch that is receptive to spin. England have a couple of injury concerns, too. They've had their struggles in the past against lower-ranked opponents and, as Andrew Miller puts it in his preview, Afghanistan are the sort of "ball-striking badmashs" who can blindside even the best-prepared outfit. Never mind that they're run into more than a few custard pies so far this World Cup, we could see a monumental upset today. This is Alan Gardner and I'll be joined by Varun Shetty in hoping to get lucky.
