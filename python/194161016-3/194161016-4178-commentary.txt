Starc to Santner, OUT, short, and he holes out to fine leg! Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. Cricket, bloody hell! It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg. The pace on the ball took the top edge and made it go finer, and Behrendorff made no mistake

What Sachin did for Ind in '03, Finch/Warner are doing it here for Aus. In '03 when ever Aus batting faltered, their bowlers decimated the opposition. The same is being done by Indian Bowlers here. IN '03 Aus were a ruthless unbeatable force and Ind were the second best, here Ind have been unbeatable and ruthless and Aus so far have been second best. "

Sam : "@ Rahul. I agree completely. The volume of cricket has led to a dilution of quality since teams keep resting their main bowlers for those meaningless ODIs to keep them fresh for tests. That has led to a massive increase in averages for modern ODI batsmen, where more players average over 50 that at any time in history. You don't see the same in tests, where only 4-5 players average 50 plus. Partly due to excellent test pitches recently but a lot to do with the best bowlers being on the park. "

That is why runs in such series are devalued in the past few years in my opinion.

Lyon to Taylor, 1 run, direct hit, has Latham made it?. Ohh this is tight. And he just about gets in. Good dive. Full length. Bat grounded. Well done. So Taylor's little nudge to Maxwell is good enough

Starc to Williamson, OUT, caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy

Great captaincy. Aussie will win this quite easily I predict. NZ missed their opportunity." --- I can see that point. But this is the partnership that New Zealand's entire ODI game revolves around.

Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps

5.06pm Quite a grandstand finish, but importantly Australia have finished with a very defendable 243 for 9 on this surface. Trent Boult with the headline performance right at the end, but it was Lockie Ferguson's pace that rattled Australia right up top. Colin de Grandhomme did a great job, too, and it was down to a rearguard from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja, with a good little hand from Pat Cummins, that has lifted them to a fighting total. Still everything to play for here, surely? Al Muthu will be at the helm when we return for the New Zealand chase. Stick around till then!

Boult to Behrendorff, OUT, HE'S GOT IT! Full, swinging away from him after pitching around leg, and given. Australia have reviewed this! It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!

If it was just for forecaster to predict the result, why would anyone be interested in playing the game at all. Forecaster should be seen as where the game stands, not to predict the result" --- Hear Charan's words of wisdom!

Sam: "Ridiculous. Why is he not bowling Sodhi" --- Agreed. I'm almost tempted to think he's been scared off it because there were two left-handers in the middle and the legspinner would be turning it into them. But Sodhi has a lovely wrong un and he'd been beating Khawaja with it. New Zealand have let Australia get away here. Big time

Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs, nicks past the keeper! If KW's getting spin off a pitch, you know it ain't straight forward. Khawaja is drawn into the drive. The ball dips in front of him, messing up his timing. Then it turns, securing the outside edge

Williamson to Khawaja, no run, tosses it up outside off from round the wicket, Khawaja jams the bat down on it and sends it to cover
Thanks Debayen. Khawaja and Carey (why is he batting at 7?!?!?) are keeping Australia in this. ICYMI, this ain't a 300 pitch. It's slow. Occasionally balls are kicking up off a good length. Good captains - and Finch certainly is one - can plug a batsman's scoring opportunities here by working the angles right. And Australia have some incredible bowlers. A 200-type score could produce a proper contest here.

Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper's gloves. Top stuff.

Ferguson to Smith, OUT, falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had 0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!

Shariq: "Amazing how someone bowling 6 overs on a trot is an extended spell nowadays. Clearly remember those days when 15 overs were the fielding restrictions and the first 2 bowlers used to consistently bowl 6 overs each on the trot. " --- The middle overs have become key in ODIs. And teams need a strike bowler to operate there

Boult to Khawaja, 1 run, gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot

Boult to Khawaja, no run, beats him again! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge

Abhijato: "Speaking of Baker Street, my Crystal Ball is wearing its Holmes-inspired deerstalker already. Warner & Finch v Ferguson & Boult will participate in a classical opening overs contest, it says... Don't be late for the start, folks!"

Carey: "Still no room for Tom Blundell who performed so well in the warm up games and is one of the best NZ batsmen around spin bowling. When will his time come?"

SimonR: "Per your introduction - why is this an almost must win for NZ. They have 11 points.. Even if they lose their last two matches the possible alternatives of Bangladesh or Pakistan (even if England squeak through) can only get to 11 max and have a worse NRR. NZ are safe it is England at risk" --- Hence the emphasis on 'almost'. A heavy defeat today could put New Zealand in a bit of a tricky spot going into their final game too, remember

1.24pm The teams have walked down the Long Room on to the field, and we have the anthems on now

David: "Interesting stat - KW and Ross Taylor have identical ODI average coming into this game (48.12), hopefully they can both increase their averages today!" --- Could have a role to play too, if Australia get the kind of start they have been getting this World Cup

F May: "Keen for this one.Trans-tasman rivalry is decades old. Has been bitter at times too (think the underarm ball, Hadlee single handedly tormenting the Aussies, the years of Bevan's middle order runaways or NZ's recent rise). Here's hoping for an awesome contest!" --- Oh completely!

Kartik: "Does Baker Street really exist in London, as Miller claims?" --- It does, indeed, and I can verify from experience that a pleasant summer's day in London is the best time to take an absolutely long walk. By the way, Gerry Rafferty even composed a paen to Baker Street

There is a sound that echoes around Eden Park. A crack like lightning. The echo of a picture perfect straight drive... FOR SIX.

There is a sound that echoes around the MCG too. The roar of 100,000 fans as they watched a left-arm speed demon shatter those poor defenseless stumps.

These sounds will be haunting Lord's today. The home of cricket getting a taste of a rivalry that is more how do you do than how dare you. Sure, it's pretty awful timing for the fans back home considering it's the middle of the night in New Zealand and Australia right now. But at least it's the weekend. So come on. Pull out that phone. Text your mates. Call them over and have an all night cricket party. Doesn't actually sound like the worst thing in the world, does it? (Don't answer that)

PS - if you're absolutely gagging to know more about Henry Nicholls (and why wouldn't you be) Alagappan had a chat with him earlier this year on his rise as a red-ball cricketer


1.02pm Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat
