Mohammed Shami to Thomas, OUT, short ball, seems to have come off his shoulder. India want to review this as Shami catches it on the follow-through! It's taken the glove as he looks to pull but sees the ball get pretty big on him, and that should be all over. Michael Gough gives this out. A TV replay leads to enough evidence to overturn the original decision, in almost perfect symmetry to how the first wicket fell

Oh the irony, if Rohit Sharma is involved in the first and last dismissal with TV replays to suggest what happened and didn't...No, looks like Michael Gough is giving this not out!

Kuldeep Yadav to Pooran, 3 wides, missed stumping by Dhoni. Tossed up very full, ends up as a full toss. The batsman is coming down the track, but the drift means it goes down leg and he misses it. Pitches and spins through Dhoni's legs - he might have been unsighted by it

Natraj: "For all the no.of people questioning Dhoni's strike rate, I don't understand how not even one question Rahul's. If Dhoni is so bad at his, how come Rahul is seen as doing a perfect job. Does it all come to just batting position? Isn't match situation more important as well?" - I think Rahul definitely needs to not let the dot balls accumulate the way he has done, and his strike rate could do with a lift, true.

Pandya to Ambris, OUT, given him! Hardik gets a wicket after a few close calls. Bowled the offcutter, and Ambris didn't read it, played all around it and was struck on his pads, right in front. Opts not to review - and I think that's a good decision. Perhaps not as good a decision by Pandya to mockingly clap and tell the batsman he has to leave.

Pranay: "Are we just going to continue to talk about India's #4 for ever? Can we discuss for e.g. Sunil Ambri's Bradmenesque average or the dip from Kuldeep? Something different please!!" - By Kuldeep's dip, I hope you mean the way he gets the ball to dip. It's a thing of beauty.

Arun Prakash: "I think the problem is not with the #4 but it's the sudden dip in Dhoni's SR. For example: In Kohli-Dhoni partnership Kohli scored 21 of 25, where as Dhoni scored 17 of 32. see how much Dhoni is putting pressure on the other end.... In earlier days, this wouldn't be the same case with Dhoni. Every match with Kohli and Dhoni, India would post 20 more runs than the desired total. But now we are struggling to get towards the par score."

There's a leg gully in place too, but that was beyond his reach

Chaitanya Ram: "On the Indian middle order problem, todays cricket demands Situational Batting Order with only openers and tail constant (bec technically same situation for them always)...rest are going to float around...so its the composition as much as the order...how about RG, KL, Kohli and then Pant, Pandya, Jadeja, Dhoni and tail...looks solid to me" --- I just hope the management is keeping track of our ball-by-ball comms.

Vatz: "The "debate" about Indian middle order is an overreaction. I think the middle order is doing fine. Jadhav got a 50 in the previous game, Dhoni in this one, and Pandya has chipped in with decent cameos as well. A hole was created at number 4 due to Dhawan's injury. India has tried Shankar so far, but they can move to DK if Shankar doesn't perform - but there's no serious crisis here I'd say. "

"For India to get rid of their Middle order problems - I think they should go for Pant-RGS at the top. Pant giving a sehwag-like start (quick fire 30-40..more a bonus..). Have KL at 4, and the remaining line up the same.. Should be a piece of cake to lift the trophy on the 14th, with this playing XI" --- I wish cricket were as simple as Samad paints here!

Pranav: "Do you also have a measure for the "stability" of a forecast? Like a stable forecast shouldn't drop by more than 20 percent if they loose a wicket." - but in some cases, a 20% fall might be valid. If India lose two more wickets with lots of overs left, given their tail, it'll be valid

Allen to Dhoni, 1 bye, this is a shambles by Shai Hope - missed two chances to stump Dhoni. Dhoni had skipped down the track a long, long way, but was beaten by the dip and turn. Hope didn't gather cleanly and missed breaking the stumps. Dhoni seemed to have given up, then saw Hope didn't have the ball and scrambled back. Hope tried to flick the ball back towards the stumps from half a foot away and missed again! Dhoni makes it back, and they even steal a bye. To complete a trifecta of misery, Hope even misses scoring a direct hit at the non-striker's end

That off stump line is great, isn't it? Roach has got three wickets with it, but Nagraj has waxed poetic about another man on Live Report. And he has a point.

Roach to Sharma, OUT, good length and has it paid dividends? There was a noise as it went past the bat and West Indies have reviewed it. Pitched on a hard length and jagged back in sharply. Rohit left a gap between bat and pad, and the ball snaked through that. Did it hit bat or pad though? The third umpire says bat, and Roach has struck a huge blow. Rohit Sharma is shaking his head as he walks off, it appears he doesn't think he got an inside edge.
