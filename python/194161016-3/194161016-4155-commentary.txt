Nitish R: "Australia's bowling unit has looked slightly weaker today. Their fourth and fifth bowlers have let them down today; especially Stoinis. Not only is Stoinis inconsistent with his bowling (though he did bowl a few good yorkers at the death today), but the issue gets amplified when Zampa goes for a lot of runs. Perhaps they should try Lyon in the next game against Pakistan. "

 I understand that the electronics in the stumps and the bails make them heavier. Why can’t the groove the bails sit in just be made shallower? Won’t that fix the problem? https://twitter.com/SkyCricket/status/1137723149125128192 …

Cummins to Dhawan, 1 run, length ball, on middle, and he mistimes a cut to point
Angshuman Hazra: "I cannot compare 1) Woodfull and the bearded doc playing on uncovered wickets but with no fast bowlers trying to hit his upper body (barring one series) 2) Viv and Sunny playing without helmets in an era where wickets were covered but quicks tried to knock them out 3) sachin, lara and ponting playing with protection and on covered pitches against bowlers who rarely go flat out..but with generally better spin bowling, fielding and analysis of batsmen's strength/weakness. But my fave is typ-2"

Shiva Jayaraman. from our stats team: Fourteen of the first-20 deliveries Rohit Sharma faced today were dots. This is sort of a template for him initially in his innings, takes his time settling in. Since the last World Cup, 68.8% of the first-20 deliveries he's faced have been dots - the third highest among batsmen to have batted 50 innings. Shikhar Dhawan too follows a similar template usually. He is seventh in this list at 64.3%. One of the main reasons India tend to start slowly in the Powerplay overs.

Vignesh: "Looking at the names to whom Kohli had lost his wickets , highly likely for Stoinis to get him today" -- Wonder if Stoinis learnt some of Kohli's weaknesses during their time together doing nets at Royal Challengers Bangalore. We have a slight delay: Dhawan getting some magic-spray on his fingers. Probably from that bouncer off the over's first delivery

Anns Mahboob: "As lacklustre and dull some may find this start from India, I must say I love it. So many teams come out in big matches with unnecessary aggression and end up losing early wickets and getting below par scores. Good Start "
