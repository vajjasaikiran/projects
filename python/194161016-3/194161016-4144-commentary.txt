Wahab Riaz to Pooran, SIX runs, that's the end of that, and it's a monstrous hit to finish it! Backed away, the bowler followed him but he still managed to hold his shape and muscle this pull to clear deep midwicket. As convincing as victories get, don't think West Indies would've even dreamt of a victory margin of this sorts. Lot of soul-searching for Pakistan, but the format gives them some leeway

Holder to Sarfaraz Ahmed, OUT, Review for caught behind Holder strayed on the legstump with a back of a length ball angling into the batsman, and he doesn't get enough on it to tickle it fine. Shai Hope immediately asked for a review though the umpire thought it had come off the thigh pad, saying he heard two noises. And Hope is right. He got a faint tickle on it, and then it went to the keeper off thigh pad. Captain gets captain, and Pakistan are sinking.

Thilan: "As much praise as is going to the Windies bowlers here, I think Jason Holder deserves a lot of praise for all the years of adversity and criticism he's faced. All the interviews he's had since 2014 saying how he wanted to bring the Windies up the rankings even as his team lost on the field. He always backs his teammates even when they're going through tough times and is showing himself to be arguably the best man-managing captain around today. "

10.27am All set then. Teams walking out. West Indies in a huddle. Ashley Nurse has a chat with Mushtaq Ahmed, a World Cup winner with Pakistan but is now on the other side as a spin consultant. 'Heart with my country, but a professional' he told us in an interview not too long ago. Imam on strike, Fakhar is the non-striker. Sheldon 'The Cop' Cottrell with the new ball.

10.21am G'day, folks. Excited to be back in the hot seat. My hunch for today: Either a 300 v 300 contest that West Indies clinch or an utterly lopsided one with Pakistan winning. What's yours? Lots and lots of Pakistani fans have trooped in already. The atmosphere is simply brilliant. Remember, it was here not too long ago that England made 481 in an ODI against Australia. That kind of score may not be breached, but you can still expect it to be high scoring nonetheless.

Both sides are now lining up for their anthems. Missing the 'conquest of paradise' theme song. Used to really get me going. Not that this one doesn't.

While you soak in Dre Russ, I'll be handing the controls over to Shashank for a bit.

10.20 am: And before the game starts, here is the big one, the one you can't miss, the one you mustn't miss - Dre Russ unplugged. Andre Russell talks shop on everything cricket - how the one-year ban affected him and was harder on him than on Smith/Warner, how he had nailed down the IPL 2019 MVP even before the tournament started, and how he can hit sixes. Lots of sixes. Huge sixes. Read it here already.

Lakshman Kumar: "More than winning and losing, teams should concentrate on the margin of defeat..! In a long tournament like this, with 10 potentially strong teams, a team's chances of making it to the Semis may be decided by the Net Run Rate..! The Proteas already took a big dent to their NRR in their first match..! "

Tanvir: "As expected, Pakistan takes the safe route of playing Haris instead of Asif Ali who could be a game changer... Babar, Haris, Imam, Sarfaraz can not play together in modern ODI cricket, specially in English condition in Trent Bridge... "

Ijlal : "Pak batting was already under pressure due to lack of tempo. To sit only power hitter Asif out is very poor decision "

10.12am: Viv Richards spotted on the ground. He's shaking hands with the West Indians. Well into retirement, but somehow he still radiates an aura of being able to hit bigger sixes than Gayle. Speaking of Gayle, he has an aura of his own of course. But he's said this tournament will be his swan song. Shimron Hetmyer thinks that is a bad idea. He wants his idol to continue playing forever.

Meanwhile, you can always hop over to our Live Report, where Danyal is manning the controls. There'll be lots of fun polls, interesting insights, and general mayhem.

10.08am: For all you Fantasy League players, we have something that will make you overjoyed. Our daily tips on what you should do. Go on, make a killing.
