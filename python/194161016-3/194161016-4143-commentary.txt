6.03pm Well, it is fair to say that the World Cup has begun with a bang. Not the closest contest you could ever wish to witness, but one packed with subplots, stand-out scenes and a crackling good atmosphere. Forget soggy street parties on The Mall. Cricket is always best when it's left to its own devices! From Andrew Miller, Alan Gardner, Liam Brickhill (sadly benched for technical reasons, but gagging to get back in the fray) and Thilak Rama, goodbye, and don't forget to tune back in tomorrow morning for West Indies v Pakistan at Trent Bridge!

And of course, if you are in the UK, Ireland, Australia, South East Asia or Hong Kong, be sure to feast your eyes on our highlights packages, and spread the word! There's one particular highlight that everyone needs to see at the earliest opportunity ...

6pm One of our main men has been dismissed by our wildcard pick for the day. If you're wondering what we're on about, you haven't checked out our World Cup fantasy tips blog

5.56pm Jofra Archer is having a chat with Sky, and admits that he was running in with a bit of extra adrenalin today. There's a different atmosphere around a World Cup match, as I think everyone at The Oval today can attest ...

Anshul Punetha: "Someone called it almost right after the first innings. An Archer hat trick and SA out for 200... Applause for that gentleman!" Indeed, not far wrong!

5.53pm Well, Ben Stokes eh? It's not gone unnoticed that he's been a bit subdued in the England team in recent times, but these are the moments that England knew he would come good for. And it's interesting too, when to think back to the aftermath of the Bristol incident and Tom Harrison's insistence on "rehabilitating him in the field..." Well that's come good...

5.46pm Eoin Morgan "Delighted with that performance, the maturity and smart cricket that we played shows our improvement in the last two years."

Stokes, "extremely impressed, he's had a day out today, with a matchwinner like that in your side ..."

On Archer: "The slowest pitch and he bowled fast and accurate, outstanding from a young guy at the start of his career."

Fielding: "Huge amount of pleasure, we won't have days like this every time out, we are looking to experiment in the field."

Here's Faf du Plessis: "We were outplayed in all three departments today. I thought 300 was a par score, we were just bowling cutters basically, pace off was working, but there were some real good batting performances from England. Tahir at the top was a plan, they are good players of pace bowling, and it worked today. The bowling was really good, we kept getting wickets, but when chasing we need partnerships, and losing Amla, was a momentum-breaker. He's okay now, when he came off he was a bit all over the place, we were a bit worried about him, but hopefully he's okay now.

"When we have Dale in our resources, we back ourselves to bowl sides out as we don't have the luxury of allrounders at 7,8 and 9."

Ben Stokes is Man of the Match: "I had a bit of a panic on, I was a little further in that I should have been, but I've the nickname, "The Claw", and luckily it stuck!"

"We were thinking early doors, it's a tricky wicket, get it up to 300-330, the slower balls were digging in a bit. Boundaries were hard to get away, but psychologically getting over 300 was a big thing. Unbelievable atmosphere, great turn-out for [my] first World Cup game."

5.36pm Well, that is a statement win ... but not for the reasons that might have been anticipated from England's frontrunning favourites. Their batting looked a touch cramped for style today, but it was their bowling and fielding that really reaffirmed their No.1 credentials. Jofra Archer was a handful in every spell he bowled, claiming key wickets, hitting Amla on the helmet and forcing his retirement; the spinners were tight and to the point. And then there was Stokes. With the bat, with the ball, in the field. He was everywhere!

South Africa ... well, they have reasons to be cheerful. Faf du Plessis marshalled his resources in the field superbly - his opening with Tahir was a masterstroke - and Ngidi and Rabada proved what a threat they are going to be in this tournaement. And though they ran out of steam with the bat, Quinton de Kock was his usual forceful self at the top of the order.

Supradeep: "I think its needless to say at this point but Stokes simply showed what exactly a 3 dimentional player is. Deserves the MOM."

Stokes to Imran Tahir, OUT, edged, gone, Stokes seals it! A thick nick to slip, Joe Root puts the cap on an outstanding fielding display, reaching to his right to intercept, and England wrap it up with 10.1 overs to spare!

Sri: "Who will be the MOM? Will it be Ben Stokes or Jofra Archer?" Well... I thought Archer was shading it, but that catch ... and that innings, and the run-out, and now in the wickets ...

W
Stokes to Rabada, OUT, short again, pulled again, held at deep midwicket again! It's Plunkett this time, stooping forward to cling on in both mitts. That was a solid connection, but the man was well placed and England's fielding has been the most composed aspect of their play today.

And two, if he's bowling, then England's best fielder is unavailable!

Riaz Shaikh: "England is a juggernaut with wheels of clay! They need to get a couple of collapses out of their system in the league games before it matters too much. " Umm... something like that!

Mihir: "Is Amla only allowed to return after the fall of 9 wickets?" Nope, he can pop back whenever a wicket falls. But there's some suggestion he failed the concussion protocol, so I suspect the docs will have the final say...

He's going to need a new lid, it seems. In fact, out comes a selection of four or five! He's not the Hydra ... That bouncer, incidentally, was 144.8kph. Brisk...

Butler is now always expected to get going from the start. Why not give Butler time to settle? Plus the minor advantage of a left-right combo." Buttler is more than capable of running riot in the last 15 ... Stokes has played a key role given how the wickets have fallen

Dave Fern: "3 wickets down, not looking good. Have been feeling nervous right from the first wicket. Why does sport have the ability to take your insides and shake them about? Nearly 11.00 p.m. here in New Zealand, but can't go to bed yet..." Nope, none shall sleep tonight!

Rabada to Root, OUT, open-faced steer and Root is gone as well! Rabada's length is ideal, just enough width to lure Root into an indiscretion, and his extra pace ensures he's not in control of the stroke. Duminy at backward point guzzles the chance in his midriff, and well ... it's game on again!

Phehlukwayo to Roy, OUT, banged in short, a wild front-foot slap, top-edge to the deep-set mid-off, and there's the breakthrough!

Rahim Chagani: "Too many all-rounders in this SA line-up. Andile is hit and miss with bat and bowl - could have brought in Miller and let JP/Aiden/Russie share 5th bowler duties.

Ngidi to Root, 1 run, that's a better length from Ngidi, and there's a hint of inside edge as Root clips a seamer down to fine leg

Jack: "Hey Liam, isn't Faf calling time of his ODI career at the end of this WC?" -- He hasn't said anything definitive, but it's quite likely. Especially if they win it

Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, laced through cover! Ngidi aimed fuller still, but this came out as a long half volley, and Root was into position with minimalist grace to put it away

Michael: "If Tahir lands em right legspinners can be very hard to play for new top order batsmen. Could be a masterstroke from the Saffas!" -- The only question is, how many overs do they give him? He's got such an important job to do in the middle overs

Ngidi to Root, no run, Root is up on his tippy-toes to get on top of another rising delivery from Ngidi, pressing it firmly to extra cover

Milind: "Actually QDK is more like Rami malek. Quite a doppelganger !"

Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, sharp bounce once again from Ngidi, and a touch of seam movement back in to the right hander too, but it's nudged off the hip and down to fine leg for one

A short, catching midwicket has been brought in now as South Africa look to attack

Ngidi to Roy, no run, there's no loosener from Ngidi as he finds immediate bite and lift outside off. But Roy does well to ride it, fending to point

Lungi Ngidi will share the early duties. Two slips in place

A brilliant first over from Tahir. How will England respond?

Imran Tahir to Root, no run, and a tight end to the over as Tahir hones in on Root's off stump and a fourth googly in a row is tucked into the leg side

Asher: "DuPlessis' Deepak Patil moment! Bairstow had not prepared for this question! Brilliant strategy. What a start to the WC "

Imran Tahir to Root, no run, quicker, and flatter through the air and Root is half forward to push it back to the bowler

Imran Tahir to Root, no run, inside edge this time, and Tahir finds more grip on another googly. But Root puts bat to ball, and keeps it out

Davo : "Who would've thought a leg spinner bowling the first ball to open a World Cup?? I'm sure this has never happened before!" -- I think you might be right

Imran Tahir to Root, no run, wrong 'un from Tahir, but Root picks it and presents bat and pad close together to keep it out

Manne Praful Ya: "first duck of the world cup "

Imran Tahir to Bairstow, OUT, Tahir strikes! Faf's tactical twist has brought immediate dividends, but it's Bairstow who falls first. He lunges onto the front foot to one that grips and turns just far enough to kiss the outside edge on the way through to de Kock, and Tahir's off in celebration! Head aloft, arms spread wide, and no-one can catch him. Pure joy, and England are 1 for 1!

JM Bairstow c ((wk))de Kock b Imran Tahir 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00

F May: "QdK cracks me up, looks just like Gomez Addams." -- Now that you've said it, I can't unsee it

Imran Tahir to Roy, 1 run, Roy is onto the front foot and off the mark straight away, pushing through extra cover for a quick single
10.30am Bairstow and Roy stride to the middle, and we're almost set. But what's this? It looks like Imran Tahir is going to open the bowling! That's a surprise, after all the hype about South Africa's pace attack and this early start. Will his job be to target Roy?

10.26am Sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, avuxeni, sawubona, ndaa, salibonani, haai and hello one and all! South Africa line up for a stirring rendition of Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika, England rouse themselves for 'God Save The Queen', and we're good to go. Lets. Do. This!

musa: "welcome Gomorezvidina, bring the action to life! " -- I'll do my best, shamwari.

James J: "Leaving David Miller out is a big mistake - capable of fireworks on his day and a game changer in the field. Duminy is past his best and not capable of the same impact." -- Having watched Duminy bat after he overcame a shoulder injury (and surgery) this summer past, I'm not entirely sure I agree. Dum-Dum looked red hot.

Abeer Ahmed : "What's the news on David Miller? Why isn't he in the XI? I know this won't get published, just answer anyway. " -- Oh ye of little faith. Miller is fit, but he's just not been picked.

10.23am Right, I've seen enough for the moment. The teams are marching down the steps for the National Anthems, which means it's time to hand out to our resident Southern African, Liam Brickhill, to pick up the narrative for the first hour of action ...

10.21am Mark: "10:30 starts tend to be OK at this time of year, but at 10:30 start in September (which happened for the 50-over Cup Final) usually meant a game that was almost over by Lunch! England to win, despite a wobble along the way." Fair point. I mean, it's not quite the NatWest Trophy is it!

10.16am Now then, we've got some opening comments from Prince Harry! "The first ever cricket World Cup took place in England in 1975," he says ... entirely accurately. He also hails the UK's cultural diversity that will enable all teams to feel as though they are playing in front of a home crowd. Again, he's got a point. And with that, he has declared the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup ... open!

Jack: "Actually, Prince Harry is incorrect, the first World Cup was in 1973, the first Women's tournament!" Very fair point. NOT entirely accurately ... (though I may conceivably have misheard his words and omitted "men's"... wouldn't want to besmirch an heir to the throne, such things don't tell to end well...

10.13am By the way, everyone. One of your duties over the next six weeks is to proselytize the hell out of this mighty sport. Here's five reasons why non-cricket watchers NEED to get involved in the action ...
10.10am While we are killing time until the start, how about immersing yourself in our live Match Day show?

10.07am Well, well. The intrigue mounts. If the ball does anything in the first hour, then things could get tasty. If it doesn't, well, England have rather enjoyed themselves at The Oval of late ...

Shaurya: "Hello from India! Parents have cancelled sports channels so that I can concentrate on my ''studies''. Little do they know, I've secretly opened cricinfo. Hope you guys can give me the same experience!!" Down with parents, up with rebellion! Your studies will be fine, cricket is an education!

suohsuibdk: "Everybody's talking about the teams they expect to go through to the semis, but not the teams they hope to go through. For me it's Pakistan (cause y'know, I hail from here), South Africa (it's ridiculous they haven't won the WC yet), England (even more ridiculous!) and New Zealand (they should have won the last WC). Final to be between Pakistan and any one of them. And guess who I want to win that." Can't imagine!

South Africa win the toss and bowl! "If there's anything in the wicket it's probably in the first hour," he says. Steyn is 80 percent, hoping he'll be 100 percent by game three, which happens to be the India fixture ...

Chris Morris also misses out, so Dwayne Pretorius gets a game.

"The wicket looks really good, it should be set fair all day," says Morgan, who confirms Wood was fit and available, but misses out to Liam Plunkett.

"All the work that's been done, it's been a collective drive, I much prefer going into the World Cup as favourites."
