4165,1stInnings$Henry to kock, no run, back of a length, angling across to off stump, opens up a little to try and work it leg side, but he's working against the angle and decides to defend instead
4165,1stInnings$0.2
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to kock, no run, ooh, that's a loose shot. Fuller, but still on a good length, and a lot wider. Throws an angled bat at it and he's lucky not to edge that
4165,1stInnings$0.3
4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Henry to kock, 1 run, length ball on off stump, uses his wrists to work it into the backward square leg region
4165,1stInnings$0.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, no run, back of a length, fifth-stump line, steep bounce. Amla lifts his bat high over his head to ensure the ball's safe passage through to the keeper
4165,1stInnings$0.5
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, FOUR runs, too straight, stays onto Amla's hip, and he tucks it away easily to the fine leg boundary. The fielder there is pretty fine, but not fine enough

4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Kock, no run, full again, a bit of late swing in to the left-hander, towards leg stump. Gets his front foot out of the way in time and clips to mid-on
4165,1stInnings$1.3
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Kock, FOUR runs, too straight. A full one straying onto the pads, and Kock works it nice and fine, and fine leg once again has no chance
4165,1stInnings$1.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Kock, no run, back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Clipped to midwicket
4165,1stInnings$1.5
4165,1stInnings$W
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Kock, OUT, bowled him, stumps flying all over the place! He's been looking for that full one angling in towards leg stump all through the over, and he bowls another. De Kock leaves a bit of a hole in his attempted on-drive - the result of his front foot not really getting forward at all - and the ball simply bursts through. Judging by how the rest of the over's gone, a definite plan from Boult - something to do with de Kock's lack of feet movement early on, and maybe the angle that his bat comes down at, from around gully or thereabouts

4165,1stInnings$1.6
4165,1stInnings$2
4165,1stInnings$Boult to du Plessis, 2 runs, gets a full one first up, outside off, and he gets a good stride out to drive with an open face to the left of extra-cover. Big mix-up between the batsmen - not sure when exactly, because the TV pictures are a complete muddle - but Faf dives and makes his ground in time to beat his throw to the keeper

4165,1stInnings$2.4
4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, 1 run, length ball, quite wide outside off. No real front-foot stride to drive through the covers, and he sends a thick inside edge running away towards fine leg instead

4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, ooh, that's a tight leave. On the shorter side of a good length, with a bit of nip back in. Doesn't seem to miss the top of off stump by much
4165,1stInnings$3.1
4165,1stInnings$2
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, 2 runs, short, but on a tight line close to off stump. Jumps to ride the bounce and just meets it with a vertical bat to send it rolling away between backward point and cover point

4165,1stInnings$3.5
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Boult to du Plessis, no run, nicely bowled. Not quite as wide as the previous one, and on a length that's juuust short of drive-able. Two slips in place, and Faf ignores the bait

4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, no run, ooh, some swing on this occasion. On the fuller side of a good length, inviting the cover drive away from the body. Amla goes for it, and the ball swerves past his outside edge
4165,1stInnings$4.3
4165,1stInnings$3
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, 3 runs, full, angling into off stump. Amla looks for the cover drive, a hands shot with feet going nowhere. The ball doesn't swing this time - he's playing for swing - and it runs away through midwicket off the inside edge. Big gap between bat and pad - that could easily have gone through
4165,1stInnings$4.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball outside off, a bit of outswing. Faf leaves it alone

4165,1stInnings$5.1
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, no run, Ooh, that's some sharp inswing. A fullish length, and once again Amla's front foot goes nowhere. Tries to flick it hurriedly, following the swing, but his front pad is in the way. No appeal - the impact was outside leg stump and the ball was missing leg too
4165,1stInnings$A wide gully in place now for Boult. No slips.

4165,1stInnings$Faf du Plessis finished the 2015 World Cup with an average of 36. He's bulked that up to 46 now thanks to a really good last four years. In that time, he's even made public a wish to move from a good player to a great player and that's the focus whenever he trains.

4165,1stInnings$6.3
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball swinging away lavishly, but the initial line is wide enough for du Plessis not to get drawn into playing at it
4165,1stInnings$6.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball, fifth-stump line, not as much swing - more a hit-the-deck type of ball. Du Plessis leaves again
4165,1stInnings$6.5
4165,1stInnings$2
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, 2 runs, ooh, that's a good ball. Full, fuller than half-volley length, and it swings away late from just outside off. Du Plessis was looking for a drive through mid-on, and he ended up opened up and edging thickly to the left of third man, where Lockie Ferguson makes a good attempt at a diving save. Looks like he's juuust kept it in with a strong swish of his left hand
4165,1stInnings$6.6

4165,1stInnings$7.3
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, shot! Given that Amla doesn't really get on the front foot to most deliveries, bowlers can occasionally try and go fuller to try and draw him forward. This one's got a bit of width on it, though, and not much swing back in, and Amla waves his wand of a bat at it - it's a diagonal bat, but does it matter when he connects so cleanly? - and sends it racing away through cover point
4165,1stInnings$7.4
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, bam. Overpitches, on off stump, and Amla just shows it the full face and finds the gap to the right of mid-off

4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, 1 run, ooh, good ball. Good length, slanting across into the corridor, and gets some extra bounce. Takes the shoulder of the bat as Amla props half-forward to defend, but he plays with soft hands and it doesn't carry to the fielder at slip
4165,1stInnings$8.1

4165,1stInnings$Sam : "Lots of talk and articles written about bat dominating ball, but there have been some brilliant fast bowling in this World Cup. " -- Indeed. Boult and Henry have been pretty good too, so far, and bowled a fuller length than most teams at the tournament. Lots of leaves - tells you how much it's swinging, and that these two have batted pretty well too.
4165,1stInnings$8.3
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, no run, third leave in a row. Slightly fuller than the previous ball, on a tight line outside off. Sees the shape on it and leaves it

4165,1stInnings$Was Amla having some trouble shuffling too far across his stumps? He's taking guard outside leg stump today, so that his shuffle doesn't take him as far across.
4165,1stInnings$8.6

4165,1stInnings$Henry to Amla, no run, length ball outside off, left alone
4165,1stInnings$9.1
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs, full outside off, and that's a good shot even though it isn't off the middle of the bat. It isn't a half-volley, and it's swinging back in, but du Plessis got a big stride forward, ensuring he reduced the width of the swing at the point of impact, and the ball rolled away to the right of mid-off off the inside half of the bat

4165,1stInnings$9.3
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs, shot! A touch overpitched this time, but again a big stride forward to ensure he's close to the pitch, and he drives between mid-off and short extra-cover
4165,1stInnings$9.4
4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Boult to du Plessis, 1 run, length ball, fifth-stump line. Presses forward, lets it come, and dabs to the left of backward point

4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, no run, shortish, off-stump line. Jumps to ride the bounce and defends towards midwicket
4165,1stInnings$9.6
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Boult to Amla, no run, beauty. He's been getting consistent swing back into the right-hander, and this one just keeps going with the angle. Back of a length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away, and it beats the outside edge as Amla aims a back-foot punch at it
4165,1stInnings$Avinash Singh: "I just came across the Sign language commentary in the Guernsey v Norway ICC Men's T20 World Cup Global Qualifier. It is just amazing in every aspect of the game."

4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, fuller than a good length and swings away outside off again, Henry wants the two slips to come into play. Du Plessis doesn't. No shot
4165,1stInnings$10.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, Henry makes du Plessis play and beats the outside edge. Good length, angling in close to off as du Plessis wafts at it. But the ball straightens away so very late to skip past the outside edge. Excellent bowling from Henry
4165,1stInnings$10.5
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to du Plessis, no run, Henry drags his length back, this keeps coming into Faf with the angle and cramps him for room. He a(wk)wardly fends the ball to the off side off the back foot

4165,1stInnings$Santner to Amla, OUT, bowled him, that's slightly loose from Amla. Good ball from Santner, though, hits an excellent length and spins from middle stump to hit top of off. Amla, though, was trying to stay leg-side of the ball and play that with an open face, looking to dab into the point region, which is a risky shot if all you're looking for is a single

4165,1stInnings$Santner to Markram, FOUR runs, shot! Tosses it up again and gives away a bit of width, but Markram still had to pierce the field with his drive - a cover, a short extra-cover, a sweeper square at cover point. He opens his bat face a bit to split cover and deep cover point.

4165,1stInnings$Grandhomme to Markram, 1 run, Boult, of all fielders, drops a catch. Wouldya believe it? He has misjudged this. He runs across to his left from deep square leg, the ball comes at him at a rather a(wk)ward height, but Boult makes life difficult for him by leaping. Both his feet are in the air as he goes for the catch with both hands. The ball ultimately pops out of his hands. Boult was never stable and Markram gets away with that airy pull off a hip-high short ball

4165,1stInnings$45.4
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Boult to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, and he absolutely smashes this. Poor ball from Boult, half-volley on off stump, and he clears his front leg, leans back, and wallops this between the umpire and the non-striker
4165,1stInnings$Van der Dussen is ready to face again.
4165,1stInnings$Yoga: "I always felt that Miller is like Raina for India, comes to bat often after 30th over sometimes after 40, has to keep the run rate right from the 1st ball, when trying to accelerate gets out mostly in 30s and some 50s and rarely gets a big one. And not the least a left handed and similar batting position." -- Pretty good comparison. Both have their technical limitations, but it's a difficult job and they've often done a very good job of it.

4165,1stInnings$Henry to van der Dussen, SIX runs, length ball on off stump, and Rassie puts it away. Clears his front leg and hoicks it over the square leg boundary. Dragged it much squarer than intended, off the inner half, but the square boundary on that side is pretty short
4165,1stInnings$Brilliant over from Ferguson, only two off it plus the wicket of Phehlukwayo. Can Henry follow up with another good'un?

4165,1stInnings$Henry to van der Dussen, 1 run, slower short ball, angling into the body, and that's dropped on the fine leg boundary. Pulled in the air, and Ferguson, coming in off the boundary and sliding forward on his knees, is in a good position to take it above his lap, but he spills it despite getting both hands under it
4165,1stInnings$47.3
4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Henry to Morris, 1 run, digs it in, back of a length, must have been the slower one, and Morris, looking to make room to free his arms, can only flat-bat it down the ground to long-on
4165,1stInnings$Third man and fine leg are up now for Morris.
4165,1stInnings$47.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to van der Dussen, no run, slower ball, fullish and fairly wide of off. Looks to go down on his back knee and heave it over midwicket, but he swings too early and only manages to send an inside-edge rolling to the keeper
4165,1stInnings$47.5
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to van der Dussen, no run, another slower one, shorter and closer to off stump. Grips the turf and keeps a little low, and van der Dussen ends up swinging above it, looking to pull
4165,1stInnings$47.6
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Henry to van der Dussen, no run, another slower one, fuller this time, but again wide of off stump. Van der Dussen looks to reverse-sweep, but can't connect yet again
4165,1stInnings$48.1
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to Morris, FOUR runs, maybe they can. Short one, gets up to shoulder height outside off. Morris looks to fetch a pull from there, ends up top-edging it to the fine third-man boundary
4165,1stInnings$Final over coming up, and it's Ferguson to finish. Can South Africa get to 240?

4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to Morris, no run, he wants to make room and go over mid-off, but this is quick and banged in short, so it rises above his attempt at a flat-bat hit over mid-off
4165,1stInnings$Third man, fine leg, deep point, deep square leg, and long-on are the boundary fielders.
4165,1stInnings$48.3
4165,1stInnings$1
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to Morris, 1 run, makes room again and Ferguson attempts to follow him with a back-of-a-length slower ball. Too early into his flat-bat hit, and it rolls to mid-off off the toe end
4165,1stInnings$48.4
4165,1stInnings$0
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to van der Dussen, no run, now Rassie makes a lot of room, and Ferguson bowls another slowie - the legcutter is his go-to variety - pretty full outside off. Big swing, looking to go over mid-off, and he misses
4165,1stInnings$48.5
4165,1stInnings$6
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to van der Dussen, SIX runs, wham, that sounded so good off the bat. Looks to make room again, and Ferguson goes short. But it sits up at chest height, within the batsman's hitting arc, and he absolutely hammers it over long-on
4165,1stInnings$48.6
4165,1stInnings$4
4165,1stInnings$Ferguson to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, great finish from van der Dussen. Looks to make room again, and this time Ferguson tries to go full. Doesn't get it full enough, and he can get underneath it and drive it hard, back over the bowler's head. Mid-off is up, and long-on is too wide, so it runs away for four to edge South Africa past 240

4165,2ndInnings$4pm Hello again. NZ need 242 in 49 overs to move to the top. Durban-born Munro and Auckland-born Guptill walk out to the middle. Faf does all the talking in SA's team huddle. Rabada has the new ball and runs in from over the stumps to Guptill with two slips in place

4165,2ndInnings$4
4165,2ndInnings$Morris to Williamson, FOUR runs, beautiful. Full, though not a half-volley, angling into off stump. Williamson brings his bat down as straight as humanly possible, showing a bat face as full as possible, and caresses it between the bowler and mid-off

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Williamson, 1 run, A lot of teams these days have a floating slip for Williamson. SA don't though. So, Williamson rides the bounce of this short ball and steers to deep third man

A short one at around chest height, hops up and across to try and glance it fine, and I don't know what it hit, but there was a faint suggestion of something - thigh pad? - on it. Not the most convincing appeal from de Kock, and Rabada wasn't hugely excited either

4165,2ndInnings$Morris to Neesham, OUT, gone! Steered straight to the man at wide slip! Morris' over-the-wicket angle to the left-handers has picked up another wicket. Cross-seam, just short of a length, angling away from off stump, and Neesham leans back and steers it, probably looking for third man, but the ball bounces a little more than he'd like and he ends up hitting it straight into Amla's lap.

4165,2ndInnings$Long-on, third man, and square leg are back on the rope for CdG.

4165,2ndInnings$Imran Tahir to Williamson, no run, follows the legbreak - a mistake he doesn't normally do, but here he needs to put bat to ball and get runs, and because of that pressure, he plays a low percentage glide with half a bat and is beaten. Waaaait, replays show Williamson bottom edged it! De Kock didn't hear it. Tahir is appealing. He's shocked no one joins him and South Africa have missed out on a big big biiiiiiiiig break

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Williamson, no run, another slower ball, and it sticks in the pitch, making Williamson's push to mid-on travel in the air for a distance. This is on a knife edge, people. South Africa can still make up for missing that review to get Williamson caught behind

4165,2ndInnings$1lb
4165,2ndInnings$Rabada to Williamson, 1 leg bye, Oh my, a comedy of errors at Edgbaston. Awful mix-up between the wickets. Miller fluffs a run-out chance and reprieves Williamson. This was another well-directed short ball at the body, comes off pretty slow off the surface. Williamson is early into the pull and wears it on his body. deGrandhomme wants a single, Williamson doesn't. Rabada, the bowler himself, swoops down on the ball. The throw is to Miller at the non-striker's end. He is in a rush. He is under pressure. He dislodges the bails without collecting the ball. What a big miss for SA. Is that the game?
4165,2ndInnings$Right then, it's down to NZ needing 58 off 54 balls with five wickets in the shed. Fasten your seat belts for this could be another blockbuster between these two sides

Pitched up and outside off, right up the alley for deGrandhomme to muscle it into the stands. He only holes out to long-off. Is there another twist in this match?

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Williamson, no run, Has that been dropped by Ngidi? Nope, that did not carry to him and he wears a wry smile. Slower cutter, grips in the pitch, chipped back, lands just in front of the bowler
4165,2ndInnings$Here comes Mitchell Santner. He is so cool and laidback that he has been nicknamed "Flatline" at Northern Districts. A slip greets him. Mid-off sent back

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Santner, no run, slower offcutter, excellent execution from Ngidi from round the wicket, beats Santner. De Kock somehow grabs it a(wk)wardly. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. He didn't even get his body behind the ball

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Santner, 1 run, slower short ball outside off, swatted away to the bowler, smashes the stumps at the non-striker's and rolls down to long-on

4165,2ndInnings$Ngidi to Williamson, FOUR runs, That artistic dab from Williamson fetches him a crucial four. Slower ball, Ngidi rolls his fingers across the ball and pushes it outside off, Williamson waits for the ball to arrive, then glides it - like only he can - fine of short third man for four. First boundary for Williamson after 38 balls, I'm told. Significant one

4165,2ndInnings$New Zealand need 8 off the last over. Can they have the times of their lives once again? Andile will bowl the final over. Faf has a lengthy discussion with him. Okay, guess what the ZING BAILS have stopped play. Scenes at Edgbaston. Sid Monga from the venue: "They are taking the bail from the non-strikers' end to the striker's end. I am not sure the zing is working on the bails now"
4165,2ndInnings$Long-on, long-off, two men in the deep on the leg side, sweeper cover in the deep. No short third man or deep third man

4165,2ndInnings$Phehlukwayo to Williamson, SIX runs, Grant Elliott: 2015. Kane Williamson: 2019. New Zealand are having the times of their lives once again. What an incredible century from Kane Williamson. This was full and outside off, slower variation, Williamson picks it, drops down to one knee and smokes it away into the stands beyond midwicket. Williamson eases the helmet off his head and soaks everything in

4165,2ndInnings$Phehlukwayo to Williamson, FOUR runs, Williamson - you beauty! It had to end this way, right? That dab down to third man. Back of a length and outside off, glides it away behind point and seals it for NZ like boss. He is the boss. Meanwhile, South Africa's World Cup hopes are effectively ended
