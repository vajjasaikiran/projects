4150,1stInnings$Which is not to say India's bowlers shouldn't take much of the credit - they should, but they've undoubtedly been helped by some variable (and sometimes alarming) bounce in the track. It's spinning, too.

4150,1stInnings$Graham : "With the intensity and passion that these bowlers are playing with so far, it may be a case of who has the most fit bowlers at the pointy end of the tournament " Yep, it's a long road. I suspect we'll see some rotation along the way

And that's what happens when Rassie telegraphs his intentions to reverse sweep, getting into position very early. But the drift takes the ball towards leg stump, and the rip sends it clattering into the timber. He's already planted his front foot, and can't reach around at the ball. Bowled around his legs!

4150,1stInnings$Chahal to du Plessis, OUT, not this time! Faf gropes forward, but he's not read it and the ball sneaks straight through the gap between bat and pad. Chahal has his second in the over, and the South African captain falls!

4150,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, 1 run, chipped uppishly, but safely through mid off and down to long off for one
4150,1stInnings$Enter JP Duminy. Like Miller, he could really do with some runs. He only has three fifties in the 31 innings he has played in the last three years at an average of 30 and SR of 86.5. A lot of Duminy's troubles are a result of his inability to neither score at a good rate in the middle overs not avoid getting out. 19 of his 24 dismissals in this period have come in the 11-40 over phase and for an SR of 73.75. In the middle, it's spin from both ends

4150,1stInnings$D: "Miller is a Finisher. Can be handy fro overs 35-50. Not Sure Why SA is not utilizing JP Duminy services in middle order (4/5 batting positions). He is used to these kind of situations and can anchor the innings very well which is proven in past and is one of the key success of SA."

4150,1stInnings$Sam: "The talk of India's bowling attack leading into the tournament was highly justified. Funny to think a few years back India were seen as a 'bowlers will allow high score, batsmen are good enough to chase it down' team, now they have an attack which is both economical and dangerous at all stages of the game." -- Indeed. Statistically, this attack has been their best between World Cups in the last 20 years

4150,1stInnings$Kuldeep Yadav to Duminy, OUT, the pressure tells! This one was slightly quicker through the air, skidding through to hit Duminy - playing right back - on the pads. It looks adjacent, it's given out, but Duminy reviews it. Needlessly so, it turns out, as three reds come back and he's got to go. It was a little desperate, but given the game situation, Duminy had to ask for another look. South Africa sink ever further

Faf and Dussen hardly looked to get out of jail and now looking too ordinary against spinners. Rassie should have gone after Hardik and given Kohli something to think about. SA for me would be out of SF race due to sheer pressure of winning 5 out of 6 if the lose this one"

4150,1stInnings$Bumrah to Rabada, no run, full ball, on the pads, and he flicks this towards short midwicket. Goes straight to Kuldeep, who has a shy at the stumps. Kohli is not too impressed, as the non-striker was comfortably in

4150,1stInnings$1
4150,1stInnings$Bumrah to Morris, 1 run, slower ball, outside off, and Dhoni spills a regulation take behind the wicket. They get a bye for this. Good deception with the ball, though, from Bumrah. Brave, with both third man and fine leg inside the circle
4150,1stInnings$Thys: "At least it looks like SA will bat out their overs, which should have been their first priority after the disastrous start. The runs are on the board, India have to get them. Time for the bowlers to stand up where they have been shown up in the previous two games."

4150,1stInnings$Ian, anyone that thinks the Proteas have a chance here is holding onto some sort of hope for the underdog, which most neutrals would have in this case. But realistically there is a very small chance of stopping a side with the quality they have in this lineup, and then the level headedness of Dohni in the middle order. This is the best chasing side in the world, add 100 runs to this score and I still believe it would be done pretty easily."

4150,2ndInnings$Shamsi to Dhoni, 1 run, steps out and drills this down to long-on
4150,2ndInnings$42.4
4150,2ndInnings$4
4150,2ndInnings$Shamsi to Sharma, FOUR runs, swept from outside off towards deep backward square. Fielder inside the ring and there was no way this wasn't going to the boundary. India starting to shift gears now, running away quickly from South Africa
4150,2ndInnings$42.5
4150,2ndInnings$3
4150,2ndInnings$Shamsi to Sharma, 3 runs, paddled round the corner, manipulation at its very best, Dhoni charges back for the third.

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Sharma, no run, tired shot but guess what? David Miller has put down an absolute dolly at cover. He wouldn't want to look into the captain's eye after that. Rabada nearly does Rohit in with a slower leg-cutter, an ugly across-the-line heave gets a top-edge. Miller settled underneath it, went with a reverse cup and put it down. Oh, dear.
4150,2ndInnings$43.4

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Sharma, FOUR runs, uses the bounce to arch back and help it over the keeper's head. This is adding insult to injury

4150,2ndInnings$Giggity: "Probably the reverse cup didn't help there. Miller's hands looks to have been in his line of sight to the ball coming down" -- Absolutely

4150,2ndInnings$4
4150,2ndInnings$Imran Tahir to Sharma, FOUR runs, fired full on middle and leg and Rohit sweeps this all along the ground to bullet this to the deep square leg fence. All along the ground, rolled his wrists nicely over the ball

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Dhoni, no run, driven to cover, rolls off the top part of the bat
4150,2ndInnings$sathish: "Like ICC announced Yuvraj as MOS earlier in WC final, I say Rohit Sharma for MoM in today's game" -- I'll go for Chahal. He set it up.

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Dhoni, 2 runs, top-edges a pull but this one rolls across to the fine leg boundary where Shamsi turns up with a clumsy effort, but manages to hurl the ball back in. Beat Dhoni for pace, like he did in Kanpur in 2015. Remember?
4150,2ndInnings$45.3
4150,2ndInnings$1
4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run, tucks this off his hip to deep square leg

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Sharma, no run, reaches out to hit this off the absolute bottom to cover
4150,2ndInnings$tanushree kulka: "The main difference has been the spinners in the 2 teams. Chahal took 4 and Kuldeep 1. Both SA spinners have gone for 6 an over without a single wicket."
4150,2ndInnings$45.5

4150,2ndInnings$Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run, reaches out and squeezes this over point. Saw Dhoni stepping out and bowled it wide.
4150,2ndInnings$sravan's theory of reverse cup: "The reverse cup is a confusing unnatural mechanism. Although it is considered a more secure way of catching, I've never understood why. The ball tends to roll down or pop out along the inner side of the cup more often than not. Having your body behind the cup would act as a natural protection. The reverse cup, as was just witnessed, just comes in the way of the catch."
4150,2ndInnings$46.1
4150,2ndInnings$W
4150,2ndInnings$Morris to Dhoni, OUT, high, very very high. Morris calls for it and as it descends, he's so into the catch that he falls over onto the stumps at the non-striker's end even as the ball lodges in his bucket hands. Called very early and completed it.

4150,2ndInnings$Morris to Sharma, 1 run, dabbed down to third man
4150,2ndInnings$Vaibhav Lall: "Should India have accelerated a few overs earlier, keeping in my how net run rate can be a critical factor in the long run in this tournament." -- If you keep stringing wins, net-run-rate won't matter. In a long tournament of nine league games, you really can't play for NRR from the first game. And it wasn't like India was facing a mediocre attack. Steyn or no-Steyn, this is still a competent attack.
4150,2ndInnings$Pandya is the new man. Not Jadhav. Rohit crossed over and is on strike

4150,2ndInnings$Morris to Pandya, FOUR runs, pulled in front of square, imperious! Hardik isn'g going to waste time. Picked the length so early. Terrific shot

4150,2ndInnings$4
4150,2ndInnings$Phehlukwayo to Pandya, FOUR runs, he's carved this behind point, races to the boundary and India begin their campaign with an emphatic six-wicket win
4150,2ndInnings$Sundar: "Weird scheduling. India have just begun their campaign and SAf with 3 losses, already have one foot out the door." -- Six more wins will do them just about fine
