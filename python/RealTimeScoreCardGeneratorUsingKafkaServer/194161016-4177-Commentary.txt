4177,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Gulbadin Naib, OUT, big nick! Or is it?! Given not out with Gulbadin driving well away from his body. Sarfaraz calls for the review! Seemed completely obvious live that he edged that ball but Nigel Llong didn't think so. Sarfaraz took an eternity to review overthinking things, i.e., was it so obvious that it wasn't an edge after all? Of course it was! Ultra-edge shows a clear spike when ball passes bat. Umpire Llong changes his signal.

4177,1stInnings$Shaheen Shah Afridi to Hashmatullah Shahidi, OUT, he's on a hat-trick! What a whirlwind over! Not the best ball to be fair. Full and angling down leg, should have been ticked through fine leg for four but Hashmatullah is out in front of the ball and his attempt to play it through the leg side results in a leading edge that balloons over Shaheen towards mid-off. Imad jogs 10 yards left and takes it at waist height in stride.

4177,1stInnings$Hat-trick ball on the way to be faced by... Ikram Alikhil?!?! Promoted up the order with not much to show for the bat so far this World Cup. Extra slip brought in.

4177,1stInnings$Imad Wasim to Ikram Alikhil, no run, pushed through fairly quick, and he jabs it away towards point
4177,1stInnings$Slip in for the left-hander
4177,1stInnings$Fahad Khan: "Pakistan is losing a plot here, Afghani players play spin better than Fast bowling, Wahab Riaz should have been bowling instead of Hafeez." - Imad has bowled pretty well to be fair, kept it tight

4177,1stInnings$Imad Wasim to Ikram Alikhil, 1 run, oooh gets a leading edge. It's just gone with the angle from around the stumps, and drifts across him, he plays for the turn looking to clip but gets a leading edge that goes through point
4177,1stInnings$another slip in now
4177,1stInnings$11.5
4177,1stInnings$4
4177,1stInnings$Imad Wasim to Rahmat Shah, FOUR runs, innovative. Rahmat shows his range, gets down on one knee and scoops this over the keeper to get a boundary very fine
4177,1stInnings$11.6
4177,1stInnings$W
4177,1stInnings$Imad Wasim to Rahmat Shah, OUT, leading edge goes to short cover. This was also bowled at 96kph, but Imad got it to grip and hold on the pitch. Also got it to turn gently. Rahmat thought there's a straightforward single for the taking to midwicket, but found that he had brought his bat down too early, and the leading edge pops up for a simple catch
4177,1stInnings$Rahmat Shah c Babar Azam b Imad Wasim 35 (54m 43b 5x4 0x6) SR: 81.39
4177,1stInnings$12.1
4177,1stInnings$2
4177,1stInnings$Mohammad Hafeez to Ikram Alikhil, 2 runs, fuller, turned around the corner. There is no short fine leg, so they sprint back for the second. Well run
4177,1stInnings$That wicket has seen a rather steep fall in forecaster - from 251 to 205 now. Understandable, since Rahmat is Afghanistan's best batsman and looked in good nick too. Here's Asghar Afghan

4177,1stInnings$1
4177,1stInnings$Mohammad Hafeez to Ikram Alikhil, 1 run, this time he's able to punch through cover, because the length is a bit shorter

4177,1stInnings$doc mudassar: "Pakistan should attack know 3 wiickets down what hafeez is doing right now poor captaincy by sarfrazz" - it's possibly because Alikhil has looked far from comfortable against spin. His promotion is still puzzling me to be honest

4177,1stInnings$Imad Wasim to Asghar Afghan, 2 runs, top edge lands clear of short fine leg. Went down to sweep but Imad got it to bounce a tad more which meant a top edge. But it lands safely, though Wahab running back is able to pull it in before it reaches the boundary

4177,1stInnings$Shadab coming on.
4177,1stInnings$Anand: "Hey Saurabh, looking at Alikhil's plight, do you think Afg shouldnt have send back Shahzad so abruptly especially with his injury not looking that "threatening" ? Or was it Afg looking for someone younger like Naib's sudden captaincy ?" - those are unanswerable questions...! Except by people in ACB, I think.

4177,1stInnings$Shadab Khan to Asghar Afghan, no run, fuller outside off, driven to cover
4177,1stInnings$Rahmanullah Sha: "I do not know why everybody is criticizing Ali Khail inclusion in the team. He is a proper batsman like Rahmat and Shaidi. He did not do good at number eight because he is not a first ball hitman. He needs time to settle. He will do best in this position. I think if you are playing Ali Khail, you have to play him at this position, otherwise, you do not play him at all."
4177,1stInnings$But for the other opinion, here's Andy C: "Interesting promotion of 18 year old Ikram to number 4 given a 12-match List A career average of 22 with strike rate of 59. He does have a FC century so his elevation must be an expression of belief in his ability. Hope he does well."
4177,1stInnings$Some of you may have wondered why Afghanistan were slow in their batting approach early on, particularly when they were chasing small-ish targets. It's because there's a worrying pattern every time they score quickly. Varun has a hypothesis over at the Live Report.

Possibly influenced by the silly point fielder in an effort to smash the ball and get him to go back to the circle, Asghar stampedes down the pitch to hammer a beautifully flighted ball on fifth stump. It holds it's line instead of turning and he's beaten trying to club this back over Shadab's head as the ball clips off stump. A promising stand ends.

4177,1stInnings$Shadab Khan to Ikram Alikhil, no run, uses his feet and is beaten by a very full ball prodding. Hit on the pads and Sarfaraz surprisingly goes for a review. Talked into it by Shadab. He was hit a long way down the pitch but was struck on the back pad in line with off stump as it beat him through the gap. Ball-tracking shows... umpire's call! Umpire Paul Wilson breathes a sigh of relief. That would have been the third overturned decision of the match and we're only just past the halfway point of the first innings. Pakistan retains their review though.

Floaty delivery at 84 kph/52 mph on about 7th/8th stump, just inside the wide guidelines, Ikram had to reach out a long way trying to slog this over long-on. Got more of the toe of the bat on it than middle and the ball loops in the air toward long-on. Simple catch taken at rib height 10 yards in from the rope.

4177,1stInnings$Andy C: "What a shame if Ikram felt he had to go for the big shot, which is not his game. He was doing fine and especially with a wicket having just gone I would have been telling him to bat through the 50 overs and just look to nudge his strike rate up, leaving the big shots to the batters at the other end. That could have got them to 250 or so. Now you could easily see them capitulating to 190 all out in 43 overs" - there is definite value in what Ikram did to hold one end up, but I felt he batted too slowly despite that role.

He tries to flick on for a runout to deny the second run but misses as Mujeeb collides trying to make his ground.

4177,2ndInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, strikes second ball!. Given lbw but the batsman goes up to review. That looked out on first sight. Pitched on a length and spun in, carrom ball, beat his defensive prod to strike him on the pad. Bat and pad are very close to together, and there is a spike. I think it's of ball hitting pad, there's a gap between ball and bat. The third umpire's thinking the same. And ball tracking shows three reds! So not only have Pakistan lost Fakhar, they've lost a review too.

4177,2ndInnings$Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Babar Azam, no run, big shout for lbw. Not given but Naib is going for a review. I think he must have been struck outside the line. Offspinner pitched outside off and Babar was coming on the front foot to defend, but had his off-stump covered. No bat involves, but yes, it's well outside the line. Strange review, and they've lost it. Maybe they thought he wasn't playing a shot, so impact wouldn't matter?

Nabi darted this in quicker at 91 kph/57 mph, and much wider too. Imam essentially yorks himself on the dance down the pitch playing over the top with a wild drive. Ikram was pulled away from the stumps on the width but still had enough time to shuffle across and dislodge the bails.
