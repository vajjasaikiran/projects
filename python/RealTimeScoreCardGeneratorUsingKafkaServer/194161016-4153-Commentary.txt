4153,1stInnings$4
4153,1stInnings$Mashrafe Mortaza to Bairstow, FOUR runs, a baseball slug off the legs! Flinging the bat across the line, nailing the connection, bissecting the fielders at backward square. Not short, not full, just sloggable

4153,1stInnings$2
4153,1stInnings$Mashrafe Mortaza to Bairstow, 2 runs, better length, angled across the right-hander, pushed down to long-off, but there's a grim misfield and a stolen bonus run .. in fact, it wasn't a misfield, Shakib chose to throw the ball to mid-on instead of the keeper!

Why SA played 3 games in same time.... is something unusual and impartial. " It is strange, isn't it? I mean, India playing late is one thing. But not sure why their first game couldn't have been someone else's second.
4153,1stInnings$Of course, had South Africa not muffed their lines in this tournament, it could have been a massive advantage to them ... confidence and form etc... but it, err ... wasn't.

4153,1stInnings$Mashrafe Mortaza to Bairstow, OUT, leading edge into the covers, and a very sharp take! What a timely breakthrough! Mortaza found some extra lift from round the wicket, Bairstow attempted a nudge to leg, but the ball popped up to short cover, where it was gobbled brilliantly by a sprint and dive from Mehedy. The stand is broken, Bangladesh have a glimmer at last!

A Jos Buttler after the 35th over or a determined Rohit Sharma would fight for second place. Think facing Riaz and the rest of Pakistan at the death falls third." Fair assessment.

4153,1stInnings$Mashrafe Mortaza to Roy, 1 run, once again, targeting that leg-stump line, desperate to avoid offering any width to Roy's long levers. So he accepts the nudge off the hips and picks off another single
4153,1stInnings$Sahil : "Don't forget Trent Boult with the new ball. He's been swinging it around, bagged 4 wickets against India in the warmup. As Monga mentioned in his article he's been outstanding since the 2015 world cup." Yep, very true ...

4153,1stInnings$1
4153,1stInnings$Mustafizur Rahman to Roy, 1 run, eases back and across, to nudge another leg-stump delivery into the gap behind square. Sharp running, but not quite sharp enough to come back for the second

4153,1stInnings$2
4153,1stInnings$Mashrafe Mortaza to Roy, 2 runs, rising up onto the toes, punched past short cover, and more really sloppy fielding! An easy single, followed by a wayward shy past the stumps, and nearly a third overthrow too... whoops

4153,1stInnings$Mohammad Saifuddin to Root, OUT, inside-edged drive! Root's knock is sawn off by a slower ball, perhaps he was through the shot too soon. Respite at last for Bangladesh, but I wonder if we might see Jos Buttler now?

It was an attempted flick to leg, no bat involved ... was it past the 3m mark though ... nope, but it was missing leg! Just starting to swing at the point of impact, which may be why he missed it

Among teams that have played at least 30 World Cup matches, only Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have fewer hundreds from openers. A record that is likely to be set right in this World Cup given the form the England openers have been in."

4153,2ndInnings$Abhishek: "The way this world cup is shaping, it looks like at least one SF spot will be decided by NRR so Bangladesh did the sensible thing here by not going for glory, then again people pay and come to watch their team giving it a whole hearted attempt to win the match.

4153,2ndInnings$Naresh: "This is a bizarre chase from BD, they never looked like they want to chase this down right from the start" When your target is more than 50 runs higher than your ODI highest score, perhaps there's no obvious place to begin!

4153,2ndInnings$Vaibhav: "Yes there has been some entertainment by Archer and Shakib. Still, would have been more fun if it was a sub 300 type pitch. Run fests are mostly boring to watch." Perhaps it is a sub-300 pitch? Bangladesh have batted pretty well you know. And England were 15 for 0 after five ...

4153,2ndInnings$Wood to Mahmudullah, OUT, leading edge, spirals high into the air, Bairstow sprints backwards and guzzles the chance! An attempted flick off the toes, but Wood's extra pace made it fraught with danger. We're nearly done here

4153,2ndInnings$0
4153,2ndInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Saifuddin, no run, bowled him ... no, the bails have stayed on! Down the leg side, under-edged into the crease, hops up into the timbers and despite an audible clunk of wood, the wicket remains intact!
4153,2ndInnings$45.4
4153,2ndInnings$W
4153,2ndInnings$Stokes to Mohammad Saifuddin, OUT, the bails aren't on any longer! That's the solution to the heavy bails 'crisis' ... hit them harder! A heat-seeker of a delivery, spread-eagling off and middle as Saifuddin plays across the line. Stokes didn't appear until the 38th over, but he's suddenly on course for a five-for!

4153,2ndInnings$Hridoy: "It would have been different match if Bangladesh batted first. The way they have batted it should have been 300+ target for England. World cup pressure!! Game on!" Maybe ... maybe ...
4153,2ndInnings$46.2
4153,2ndInnings$1
4153,2ndInnings$Wood to Mashrafe Mortaza, 1 run, short and agggressive, and eventfully played by Mashrafe, limboing out of line and deflecting very fine through third man. A fine tumbling stop to intercept the boundary
4153,2ndInnings$46.3
4153,2ndInnings$4
4153,2ndInnings$Wood to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, FOUR runs, climbing into the ribs, and flicked with some panache behind square. Cramped on impact, but watched the ball well

4153,2ndInnings$Wood to Mashrafe Mortaza, 1 run, shows all three stumps, inviting the yorker, and biffed with intent into the off side
4153,2ndInnings$46.6
4153,2ndInnings$4
4153,2ndInnings$Wood to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, FOUR runs, pounded back through the bowler's followthrough! This is good from Bangladesh, no surrender to futility, just a volley of strokeplay. Wood was collapsing a touch in his followthrough, as he is wont to do, and his outstretched hand can't intercept

4153,2ndInnings$Shake: "Ever since I have learnt how to play cricket I was always told take one game at a time. These players accepted defeat during innings break Because they are thinking 9 games ahead wow!! Not a single thought on how millions of people are feeling right now. I am disgusted by this chase approach. I am so ashamed I rather die fighting than accept defeat without a fight. " Heroically futile attitude. Nice knowing you!

4153,2ndInnings$Frank: "Help please! Looks like NRR could be a factor. In which case, given England are going to win, wouldn't it be better for them to bowl defensively/boringly?" True, though the best way to resolve NRR is to bowl your opponents out

4153,2ndInnings$Archer to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, OUT, short and wide, draws the ambitious slap through point, but it's a thin edge to the keeper! Mehidy chooses the valiant way to go - that will please the death-or-glory mob - and England are one wicket from victory

4153,2ndInnings$Archer to Mustafizur Rahman, OUT, fizzing bouncer, flicked to the keeper, and that's the end of that! That was a savage finale, speared right in at the tailender, who had nowhere to go, and a looping catch was gobbled by Bairstow.
