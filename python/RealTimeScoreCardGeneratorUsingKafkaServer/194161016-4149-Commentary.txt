Lakmal wanted a second and Malinga was slow coming back. Dawlat chases it down from short fine leg and an off balance relay is rushed to Shahzad.

4149,1stInnings$Jarrod Kimber from the press box: The adjusted target will be 14/15 less, according to ICC scorer
4149,1stInnings$Adi: "Ankur - SL still might see and should see Nabi as a batsman. (He is in my fantasy league)" Astute observation
4149,1stInnings$Qaaid Mowlana: "Honestly, SL don't deserve to win this match. This batting performance has been nothing short of disgraceful. For all the talk of the potential and ability of Kusal Mendis, he's lasted 3 deliveries across 2 games and has a grand total of 10 ODI ducks, which happens nearly once every 6 matches. Dhananjaya de Silva hasn't done too much better either. Talent is all well and good, but it's worthless if the results are this bad"
4149,1stInnings$3.30pm So, we have a 4pm start - half an hour from now - and not a significantly curtailed game. It's 41-overs per side and a ten minute innings turnover. Good news for Sri Lanka, they'll see no more of Mohammad Nabi
4149,1stInnings$Thanks, Peter. And I bring with me encouraging news. All the covers are off and the umpires have also walked out to the middle for the promised inspection
4149,1stInnings$3.15 pm - Inspection in 10 minutes! That's my cue to exit stage left for now. Hope you were mildly entertained over the course of the past two hours, chicken korma and all. Ankur is here!
4149,1stInnings$Tillakaratne Dilshan meanwhile has been stewing during the rain break over the Sri Lanka collapse. According to Dilshan, his countrymen have been batting like 'small kids'.
4149,1stInnings$As the ground staff gets moving in Cardiff, here's some non-cricket reading material to pique your interest: The Jamaican Reggae Girlz are the first Caribbean team in history to qualify for the FIFA Women's World Cup, which starts later this week. And the biggest catalyst for that team's rise has been Bob Marley's daughter.
4149,1stInnings$3.00 pm - THE RAIN HAS STOPPED! Now it's a matter of how much water the ground is able to soak up. It's been coming down for just about two hours. May take a bit more time before a possible resumption, and that's if the rain doesn't come back.
4149,1stInnings$Still raining in Cardiff, but Sharda Ugra has some intelligence info to share for traveling media heading to Cardiff for the next match at the venue on June 8 between England and Bangladesh: "Coffee is a 6/10, tea is 10/10 for range [of options]." Separately, a papare band from Melbourne has gotten back to playing their music in the stands after taking a break for lunch.
4149,1stInnings$Osama: "Finland became the Ice Hockey champions for the third time. It's ridiculous to even consider them an underdog. Afghanistan, definitely come as an underdog." Jari Kurri, Teemu Selanne and Esa Tikkanen, who are doubtless hardcore ESPNcricinfo ball-by-ball commentary fans, have just given a raised eyebrow at the earlier underdog claim put on Finland...
4149,1stInnings$2.37 pm We're now at 90 minutes of play lost since the umpires took both teams off the field, so now into deducting overs territory. :-( Reminder that there's no reserve days in the round-robin pool stage so if they can't get at least 20 overs in the second innings, the teams split points. Not sure which team will be more disappointed. In spite of Sri Lanka's collapse today, Afghanistan's batsmen didn't cover themselves in glory during their tournament opener.

4149,1stInnings$DANISH Khan : "Did you use DARLING, so your wife cook for you again? Or u use it as she is also reading. BTW, I m just taking sun bath under UAE FURIOUS SUN" - Option C Danish: Making up for the time I told her that the best chicken korma I ever had was at an Indian restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii.

4149,1stInnings$Nikhil N: "What is the highest number of extras in a World Cup match" and "was there any match with extras more than the score of the batsmen"" The record for extras in an ODI was done twice by Pakistan with 59 conceded v Australia at Brisbane in 1989 and again in the 1999 World Cup v Scotland. As for extras as high score in an ODI innings, it has happened on 39 occasions. The highest extras and team total were both done by New Zealand v Pakistan at Old Trafford in 1999 World Cup - 47 in a total of 241 for 7 - while the most recent instance happened in 2013 when West Indies batsmen could not top 17 extras in a score of 70 against Australia at Perth.
4149,1stInnings$While you're waiting out the rain, hear what Daren Ganga and Ajit Agarkar have to say on ESPNcricinfo's Match Day during the delay. Our pair of studio experts say Sri Lanka could be in an even bigger hole if Rashid had been brought on earlier. I mean, Nabi was communicating much the same with us telepathically on the ball-by-ball reader feedback while he was in the middle of his first spell around the 15th over.
4149,1stInnings$World Cup playing regulations state that there's 75 minutes of wiggle room before overs get deducted. So we've got about an hour more to go before we hit that mark.
4149,1stInnings$Radar is showing a cell of rain hovering around the ground for the next hour or so. Sharda Ugra from the ground is reporting that the rain has gotten heavier.
4149,1stInnings$Ishan: "What is with all the extras?? It's like SL have 12 batsmen!" Afghanistan have really let them off the hook with the no balls and wides. Not just that, Sri Lanka scored a boundary off of each of the three free hits following Gulbadin's three no balls.
4149,1stInnings$1.06 pm. And the groundstaff charge onto the pitch! Unbelievable drama ramps up a notch as the match is stopped with the rain getting too thick! An hour ago, Afghanistan wouldn't have minded a rain break but now Sri Lanka are the ones probably over the moon to have a chance to get up off the mat for a standing eight-count.

4149,2ndInnings$Lakmal to Hazratullah Zazai, no run, HOW DID THIS MISS THE STUMPS!?! Very full almost yorker length ball on off stump, Zazai swings over the top of it playing across the line, it barely misses shaving off stump.
4149,2ndInnings$From Jarrod Kimber in Cardiff: I asked Galbadin if a shortened game would play into his hands, he said, "So if we can reduce the overs it will be much better for us. We have potential now so like limited overs, so like everyone knows about Afghanistan batting lineup, so it will be good."

4149,2ndInnings$Jenil: "This is one of those rare occasions where you see the beauty of DLS method as the score of first innings got reduced rather than incremented. This happened because SL had little resources available at the interruption(2 wickets, 17 overs) and they would eventually consume more resources compared to what Afg would have available at the start of their innings with 41 overs and 10 wickets.

4149,2ndInnings$Udana to Rahmat Shah, OUT, great bowling by Udana is rewarded! Udana kept on teasing Rahmat with that fourth/fifth stump line on a consistently good length. After nearly dragging on earlier in the over playing away from his body, Rahmat is sucked into another play well away from his body and this time it clips the outside edge. It carries to Mathews at thigh height, as he crouches slightly to cushion the take in the breadbasket. Sri Lanka starting to claw back!

Thisara had about 1.5 seconds to cover 15 yards haring to his left. The ball never got more than 10-15 yards above the ground but he judged it immaculately before diving forward to clasp on two inches above the turf. Spectacular, a momentum-shifting effort!

4149,2ndInnings$Cheers, Ankur. Well, Sri Lanka were 3/1 underdogs according to the UK high street oddsmakers at the start of this chase, but the tables turned almost in the exact opposite direction when Nabi fell to make it 57 for 5. At that stage, Afghanistan became 10/3 underdogs but have clawed back and now the oddsmakers have it straight down the middle. DLS calculation has Sri Lanka ahead though if the match were to end right now. Par after 20 overs is 105 with Afghanistan 5 down.
