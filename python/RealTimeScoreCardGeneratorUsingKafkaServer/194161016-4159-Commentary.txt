4159,1stInnings$Alex - Do you really believe NCN is rested?

4159,1stInnings$NLTC Perera to Maxwell, FOUR runs, he whips this from outside off stump through square leg! Not quite a six but a seriously good shot! That was an excellent wide yorker, he stepped outside off and whipped it with the bottom hand just past square leg and the man at deep midwicket can't cut it off!
4159,1stInnings$Can the big show delivery off the last ball?

4159,2ndInnings$2.40pm Thank you, Alex. Welcome back. We are minutes away from Sri Lanka's chase. If you need to know, "Karunaratne is a massive Starc bunny in Tests," Fidel informs me from Cardiff (He's away at Afghanistan v South Africa). He got him five out of the six times (all cheaply) in the 2016 Test series. Two out of three times in the series this year. Let's see how Sri Lanka's captain will respond against his nemesis. Kusal Perera walks out to open with him. This should be fun. It's pretty dark and the flood lights are taking effect at The Oval.

4159,2ndInnings$Starc to MDKJ Perera, no run, length ball veering in from wide of the crease, Kusal is hit high on the pad as he plays outside the line. Beat him on the inside edge. Good bowling

4159,2ndInnings$Starc to Karunaratne, 2 runs, steered over the diving Maxwell at point, down to square third man. Richardson had to move to his left this time, comfortably back for the second run

4159,2ndInnings$Starc to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, stands tall and spanks this wide of point. Got on top of the bounce, used the width and let his timing do the rest. Superb from the skipper. Sri Lanka couldn't have asked for a better start. Gets their fans going, the flags are out

4159,2ndInnings$Cummins to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, helped along to fine leg. Did he get some bat on it? Yes, a very faint one onto the thigh pad. He was hurried for pace first up.

4159,2ndInnings$Cummins to Karunaratne, 3 runs, full on the pads and Dimuth nearly flicks this into the gap past the diving square leg fielder. The ball slows up near the boundary. Excellent wrist work
4159,2ndInnings$Sumant: "SL chased a similar target (322) in the Champions Trophy against India. So they are capable of doing this today." -- Oh yes, absolutely. Remember Asela's heroics towards the end. Terrific hitting.

4159,2ndInnings$4
4159,2ndInnings$Cummins to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, he's blasted this pull in front of square, tracer bullet stuff! Picked the length early and flat-batted this disdainfully. This is an excellent start for Sri Lanka, stand-and-deliver stuff

4159,2ndInnings$Cummins to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, pulled! This is even better. Right off the middle. Into the gap between midwicket and square leg.

If they sustain this for 20 overs they will be over the DLS par score.

4159,2ndInnings$Cheeky Davo says: "The root cause of SL's miserable batting is so simple I can't believe they haven't addressed it yet. All their greats had long, grand names - Jayawardene, Sangakkara, Jayasuriya, Kaluwitharana, etc. Even their half-decent players - Mahanama, Samaraweera, etc. I can't see them going far with Perera, Mendis and Matthews. They need change their names for the scorecard and jerseys - pronto!" -- Don't agree with the 'half-decent' tag for Samaraweera. He was an excellent Test batsman

4159,2ndInnings$Richardson to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, dismissed from his presence! Banged in short, Perera wallops this pull in front of square. Raced away to the fence. Tired delivery from Richardson, not going to help bowling such lengths in the mid-130s. Cracking stroke that has forced a new bat on its way. The Sri Lankan fans in the stands are loving it, absolutely loving it.

4159,2ndInnings$Monga's musings from The Oval: Sri Lanka have had a great start, getting the better of all the four quicks from Australia, but they also seem to have enjoyed more than a bit of luck. Apart from the edges etc, just look at the control factor. When Australia batted they were in control of 90% of the deliveries in the first 10 overs. Sri Lanka have controlled only 65%. However, when Australia were in control they scored at under a run a ball. Sri Lanka have gone almost twice of that rate in deliveries they have been in control of. The message is clear: Sri Lanka have less to lose in this match, and they are going all out, taking more risks. And with every single and double - forget boundaries - the crowd is getting more and more into this game. During the first half it seemed there were only a few Sri Lanka supporters in the crowd, but they have found their voice now.

4159,2ndInnings$Arty says: "Australia still have hope. Don't forget Sri Lanka were 140 odd for 1 against Afghanistan and got bundled out for 201. On a side note, wonder how awful does Warner's innings look in hindsight. Control percentage is nice and all but if it means Australia ended up 30 runs short does it matter? I'm sure they'd happily swap Warner's control rate and strike rate given the choice."

4159,2ndInnings$Gorsi: "Alex, why when a batsman becomes captain, always becomes more careful. They should be taking the same responsibility even when they are not captaining the side. Look at Dimuth, who knew him before the WC, and now he is leading the charge against one of the dangerous bowling attack." Some men rise with the responsibility. It sharpens their focus. Also gives them a greater purpose than their individual score.

4159,2ndInnings$Vijit : "I am unable to understand this strategy of Finch of allowing the new batsman to settle by bowling Maxwell upfront. It's more like underestimating your opponent, could well be a game-changing decision too." He's a good match up to the two left handers and he has to get 10 overs out of him. He should have had Dimuth. If you leave it later then the right handers like Mendis and Mathews could climb into Maxwell.
