4191,1stInnings$Archer to Finch, OUT, Ooooooh, Finch has been given out lbw by umpire Dharmasena. Finch reckons he has snicked it? Finch has a word with Warner and challenges the on-field out decision. Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch

Handscomb plays down the wrong line and is rapped on the front pad well above the knee-roll. Reckon height may be a concern here. Impact in line, but the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump.

4191,1stInnings$Rashid to Carey, OUT, skips down, flicked leg side... but too well! Picks out deep midwicket on the fence!

The ball actually hit the thigh pad, skidding on inside a woolly waft from Stoinis, and after an age Dharmasena's finger went up! Smith gives a look of anguish at the non-striker's end as Stoinis heads off. Might well have been umpire's call - but what a call that was!

They have twice defended lower totals to progress in World Cup semi-finals (although, unlike in 1999, a tie might not be enough). One thing we can be clear on: the first 10 overs here are crucial. Trevor Bayliss said a few days ago that his team weren't scared of chasing. What about the England fans out there? Nervous, much?

4191,2ndInnings$Starc to Roy, SIX runs, pitched up and flicked off the pads, is fine leg in the game... No, it goes all the way for six! Familiar wristy pugilism from Roy, who purses his lips and wanders up the track after watching the ball clear the rope and thump into the boundary boards

My comment finally got published :-; and by way I am rooting for NZ-Eng final (before the semi final began even though I am a true India fan) especially after reading that Ian Chappell article few days ago! #bestforcricket" I think, to be fair to Chappelli, that forecast was a final-par pay-off that got turned into a headline.

4191,2ndInnings$Bairstow is going to require some treatment from the physio, looks like he jarred his left knee or ankle while turning for the second run. No sign yet that they are going to take him off - yep, he's strapping his pads back on, the Magic Sponge™ having seemingly done its work

Full inswinger from over the wicket, Bairstow plays around it and is pinned on the back leg in line with middle. This is cannoning into middle and there's a tiny opening for Australia

Lifter at the arm-pit of Roy, heading down the leg side, Roy aims a pull, but it's miles away from his reach. Good grab from Carey - injured jaw and all - but the question is was there bat on this? Replays suggest Roy did not touch it. England have lost their review and Roy has to go. He's seething, but umpire Erasmus chats with him and sends him off. He throws his gloves in the change room

4191,2ndInnings$5.40pm: After 47 games in the 2019 World Cup, there's the small matter of one more at Lord's on Sunday. It's a game that will be shown free-to-air in the UK, too, live on Channel 4 [everyone at the ECB breathes a huge sigh of relief]. It's coming home - well, it's coming to the Home of Cricket, at least. Can England complete the job and lift their first World Cup, or will it be the Blackcaps breaking English hearts along with their own duck? Either way, you can follow it all with us. For now, it's goodbye from myself and Deiva, as well as Miller and Al on the Live Report. Thanks for getting involved. Cheerio!
4191,2ndInnings$5.25pm: Time for the captains, starting with Aaron Finch: "Totally outplayed today, the way they had us 27 for 3 after ten set the tone. You expect the new ball to come on on any surface, they bowled a great length. Still a lot of positives to take out of the World Cup campaign, we've come a long way since the last time we were in England. You always want to win, you come thinking you can win, but there have been positives, even the last six months, lot of backs to the wall and a lot of character on show. But it still hurts. [England start with bat] We tried to change it up, looking for wicket-taking options. They played exceptionally well, we know how dynamic, dominating they are. One of those days, we didn't execute as we could have and you get hurt by a good team. [Loss to SA meant Edgbaston semi] You've got to beat everyone, so can't read too much into that. We came here with a couple injuries but that's not an excuse. Came wanting to win but it wasn't to be."
4191,2ndInnings$England captain Eoin Morgan: "Absolutely delighted. We'd like to thank the fans, unbelievable support, Edgbaston has been very kind to us and no doubt people at home, too. To be honest, having beaten India at this ground, we'd have come here with similar confidence, taken the momentum from the group stages. We talk about getting better and better, we set the tone from ball one and got on top. [Woakes?] Extremely happy, he's a cool customer, goes about his business day in day out exceptionally he's one of the best in the first ten overs, him and Jofra were outstanding and the guys backed that up, which allowed us to stay on top. [Roy innings] Him and Jonny at the top are quite imposing. They are in the form of their life, if they can get themselves in great, it sets the tone for us. [Last WC final appearance] I was six, I don't remember much, seen the highlights so we watch it a lot. [Lord's on Sunday] It's an opportunity, a huge one at that. Looking back to where we were in 2015, it's a dramatic improvement. Everyone in the dressing room can take credit. We want to make the most of the opportunity."
4191,2ndInnings$5.15pm: We are going to see a new name on cup... Australia's reign is over, defeated in a World Cup semi-final for the first time. New Zealand await, but England will celebrate for now - in fact there are fireworks going off at Edgbaston. I wonder if they would have been used for an Australia win? It's actually started chucking it down, but nothing can rain on England's parade; they've won a World Cup knockout game for the first time since 1992, the tournament which also marked their last appearance in the final.
4191,2ndInnings$Chris Woakes is named Man of the Match: "Pretty speechless actually, incredible performance from the team, starting with the bowling and the way the guys finished that off was outstanding. There were some nerves around, a few anxious people in the dressing room - that's natural in the semi-finals of a major tournament. The way we produced the goods showed how good we are and how we perform as a team. [First ball hit for four?] I just got my length wrong, got a little bit full and a world-class player like Warner is going to put it away. Got my length right and felt good after that. [Important to get early wickets?] Yeah, I don't think it was a bad wicket by any means and when you get wickets at the top they have to rebuild, and we kept the pressure on. We got off to a flyer chasing a relatively small total and that's probably the difference. [Criticism after Lord's Australia defeat] We try not to look at what people are saying, could have bowled fuller at Lord's, but we've had momentum from playing two good games against India and New Zealand and carried it on today. [First final since 1992] It probably hasn't sunk in, to win in the fashion we have against Australia on the best ground in the world is incredible and really looking forward to Sunday."
